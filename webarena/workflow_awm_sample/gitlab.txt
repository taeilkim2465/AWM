You didn’t include a new list of tasks, so I’ll describe a precise, repeatable method you can use to extract common workflows from any set of web-navigation tasks, plus formatting rules and an illustrated example (using your provided concrete example).

Rules / constraints to follow
- A workflow must be a commonly-reused subroutine (a repeated subsequence of actions) appearing in at least two tasks.
- Each workflow must contain at least two steps.
- Replace non-fixed elements with descriptive variable names (e.g., input_text, button_text, category_name).
- Keep invariant element values (IDs, stable labels) unchanged when they appear across tasks (e.g., click('227')).
- Do not produce overlapping or highly similar workflows—prefer the largest, most useful repeated subsequence. If two candidate workflows overlap, choose the one that is longer or more frequent.
- Try to produce workflows that together cover as many tasks as possible.

Procedure (step‑by‑step)
1. Parse tasks into ordered action sequences.
   - Normalize action types to a small set (click, hover, type, select, submit, send_msg_to_user, etc.).
   - Keep action parameters exactly as given; mark variable content as candidate variables (text typed, button labels).
2. Identify repeated subsequences:
   - Search for subsequences of length >= 2 that appear in at least two task sequences.
   - Prefer contiguous subsequences (exact repeated order) but consider near-identical sequences where only a parameter differs.
3. Generalize repeated subsequences into workflow templates:
   - Replace differing values with descriptive variable names (input_text, menu_item, category_name, search_query, order_status).
   - Keep invariant IDs/strings intact.
4. De-duplicate and remove overlaps:
   - If two workflows are similar, keep the more general or more frequently used one.
   - Avoid producing two workflows where one is a strict subset of the other unless both are clearly useful in different contexts.
5. Name each workflow concisely (e.g., "Open account order history", "Search site with query", "Navigate to product category").
6. Validate coverage:
   - Ensure each task's actions can be expressed as a composition of the extracted workflows plus a small task-specific tail.
7. Format output as a list of workflows, each showing the thought and the action steps with variables where appropriate.

Formatting template for each workflow
- Workflow name
- Optional brief description
- Steps: alternating think/instruction and action lines
- Use variable names for non-fixed elements

Illustrated example (derived from your concrete examples)
Workflow 1: Open account → My Orders
- Description: Navigate from current page to the "My Orders" page in the user's account.
- Steps:
  - think: To view order history open My Account.
  - action: click('227')
  - think: To view orders click My Orders in the account sidebar.
  - action: click('1843')

Workflow 2: Extract order info from Orders table
- Description: Read information shown on the My Orders page (e.g., earliest purchase date, recent canceled order number).
- Steps:
  - think: To obtain order information (date/order number/status) read the Orders table and identify the target row/value.
  - action: send_msg_to_user('RESULT_VARIABLE') 
  - (Note: RESULT_VARIABLE should be constructed from the table content, e.g., earliest_date or order_number)

Workflow 3: Navigate site category via hover menus
- Description: Open a top-level menu, hover submenus, then click specific subcategory.
- Steps:
  - think: To browse category_name open the top-level menu.
  - action: hover('735')        (top-level menu ID)
  - think: Reveal subcategories under parent_category.
  - action: hover('786')        (submenu ID)
  - think: Click the desired subcategory link to open its product listing.
  - action: click('797')        (subcategory link ID)

Notes and tips
- When replacing a text parameter with a variable, choose a descriptive name: e.g., type(input_field='search_box', text=search_query) → type('search_box', search_query).
- If an invariant appears with both ID and label across many tasks, keep the ID (it’s stable) and optionally annotate the label in the think text.
- If a repeated action includes a different but semantically same target (e.g., two different IDs for similar menu items), consider creating a more general workflow only if both are same logical step; otherwise keep them separate.
- If many tasks contain a common "open My Account" but only a few continue to "My Orders", you can still produce both workflows (one shorter, one longer) but avoid making them redundant—prefer the longer if it’s frequently used.

If you want, paste a specific list of tasks now and I will run this procedure and return a set of extracted workflows formatted like in the example.

click('id') # input string id value for all actions

select_option('id', 'value') # for dropdown menu
