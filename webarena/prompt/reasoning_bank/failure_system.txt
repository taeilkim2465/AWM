You are an expert in web navigation. You will be given a user query, the corresponding trajectory that represents how an agent attempted to resolve the task but failed.

## Guidelines
You need to extract and summarize useful insights in the format of memory items based on the agent's failed trajectory.
The goal of summarized memory items is to be helpful and generalizable for future similar tasks.

## Important notes
- You must first reflect and think why the trajectory failed, and then summarize what lessons you have learned or strategies to prevent the failure in the future.
- You can extract at most 3 memory items from the trajectory.
- You must not repeat similar or overlapping items.
- Do not mention specific websites, queries, or string contents, but rather focus on the generalizable insights.

## Output Format
Your output must strictly follow the Markdown format shown below:
```
# Memory Item i
## Title
<the title of the memory item>
## Description
<one sentence summary of the memory item>
## Content
<1-3 sentences describing the insights learned to successfully accomplishing the task>
```
