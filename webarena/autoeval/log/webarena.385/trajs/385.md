## Intent

List the customer names who thinks EYZUTAK phone cases are of good looking

## RM

Thoughts: This was an information-seeking task. The agent returned a list of customers who said the EYZUTAK case looks good (and noted excluded negative reviewers), and offered to check additional pages. The visible snapshot supports at least Lisa Lee and MH as positive reviewers; the action history shows the agent navigated through reviews before reporting. The response therefore provides the requested information rather than an error or omission.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will check the provided memories to decide which to use now:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 (use the page find / search) because I need to locate reviews or product pages for "EYZUTAK" quickly on the site. I will not use Memory 1 (inferring customer pain points) because the user asked specifically for customers who said the cases are "good looking", which requires reading actual reviews rather than inferring issues. I will not use Memory 2 (check contact fields) because we only need reviewer/customer names, not contact info.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (infer pain points): Not needed — the user asked for customer names who said the EYZUTAK case looks good, so I need actual review text/names, not inferred pain points.
===============INFO - I'll consider the provided memories before acting.
===============INFO - I'll use the provided memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Infer customer pain points from observable product attributes): I will not use this. We have actual customer reviews on the page, so there's no need to infer opinions from product attributes.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Infer customer pain points): I will not use this — direct customer reviews are available on the page, so no need to infer complaints.
