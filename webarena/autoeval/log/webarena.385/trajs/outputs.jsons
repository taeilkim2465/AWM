{"id": 385, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This was an information-seeking task. The agent returned a list of customers who said the EYZUTAK case looks good (and noted excluded negative reviewers), and offered to check additional pages. The visible snapshot supports at least Lisa Lee and MH as positive reviewers; the action history shows the agent navigated through reviews before reporting. The response therefore provides the requested information rather than an error or omission.", "status": "success"}}
