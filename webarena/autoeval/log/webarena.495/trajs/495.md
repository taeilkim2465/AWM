## Intent

Notify Lily Potter in their most recent pending order with message "Thanks, your order is ready to be shipped!"

## RM

Thoughts: The order page shows the comment "Thanks, your order is ready to be shipped!" in the order history with the label "Customer Notified" and the order remains Pending. The action history included filling Lily Potter and submitting the comment. These indicate the notification was sent to the customer as requested.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It recommends filtering to "Pending" status and sorting by date (descending) before choosing the most recent pending order — that is exactly the correct approach here.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I'll filter the orders to "Pending" and sort by date (newest first) once I open the Orders grid, to find the most recent pending order for Lily Potter.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — The page already shows Active filters "Keyword: Lily Potter" and "Status: Pending", and the Purchase Date column is sorted descending (arrow). That matches the memory guidance to restrict to pending and sort by date before choosing the most recent. So I will use that to confirm this is the most recent pending order.
