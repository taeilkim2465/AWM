## Intent

Lookup orders that are processing

## RM

Thoughts: The "Status: Processing" filter is active (shown under Active filters) and the results show "3 records found" with rows displaying Status = Processing. The agent successfully located the processing orders and displayed them.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the memories that describe how to find processing orders by scanning the Orders list (Memory 1 and Memory 3). I will not use Memory 2 because it advises avoiding processing/pending orders, which contradicts the current task (the user asked to look up processing orders).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Relevant — it instructs to open the orders/account page and filter for "processing" orders. I will use this guidance.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they both recommend opening the orders list filters and filtering by statuses that indicate "processing" to find the most recent processing order. I will not use Memory 2 because it advises excluding processing/pending orders (which contradicts the user's request to look up processing orders).
