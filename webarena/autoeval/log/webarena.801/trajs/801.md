## Intent

create a new group "crew" with members ASWATFZLLC, patrickhlauke, westurner, linkmatrix

## RM

Thoughts: The group "crew" was created (left nav shows crew) and the Invite members modal is open. The member input contains Aswat FZ LLC, Patrick H. Lauke, and Wes Turner, but not linkmatrix — instead it shows "Robert". The Invite button is disabled, so the invitations were not submitted. Because the required member linkmatrix was not added and invitations were not sent, the task did not complete successfully.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm entity creation completed): I will use this — after creating the group I will wait for a success indicator or check the groups list so I don’t attempt to add members before the UI is updated.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items to guide the flow:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I will verify the group is created successfully before trying to add members (look for confirmation or the group page).
===============INFO - I'll use the provided memories:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Confirm entity creation completed before performing follow-up actions — I will use this. The page shows the success alert "Group crew was successfully created." so creation appears complete.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It reminds me to confirm the group was created before adding members. The page currently shows "Activity · crew" which indicates the group exists, so I'll proceed but still verify the members view loads successfully.
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories to guide the next step.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to guide this step, but not Memory 3.
