## Intent

What is the price range of teeth grinding mouth guard in the One Stop Market?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task (user asked for a price range). The agent performed a search and selected "Sort By: Price" but never extracted or reported any prices. The final page screenshot shows the search results (Items 1-12 of 4944) and product images but no visible prices or a stated min/max range. Because the agent did not provide the requested price range or explicitly state it was unavailable, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (state the scope) and Memory 3 (use sorting) for this step:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (state scope of reported prices) — I will use this. I'll report that any range I find is from the visible results after I change sort order, and I'll offer to expand to the full result set or check the other end (highest price).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (state scope): I'll use this — I'll make it clear the price range I report is from the visible results and offer to expand to the full result set if you want.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (state the scope and offer to expand) because I should report whether the price range I find is from the currently visible results and offer to check the full set if the user wants. I will use Memory 3 (use sorting to find min/max prices) because sorting ascending and descending by price is the fastest way to surface the lowest and highest prices. I will not use Memory 2 (date-range assumptions) because it is not relevant to this product-price task.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (State the scope): I will use this. I'll report that any price range I read immediately after sorting will be from the visible results/page and ask whether to scan the full result set (e.g., check more pages) if the user wants the complete range.
