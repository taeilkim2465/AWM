## Intent

Reduce the price of green Hollister backyard sweater in all size by $5

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only performed searches/filters (filled search terms "Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt" and "Green") and did not open any product edit pages or change any price fields. The final product list still shows unchanged prices (e.g. a simple variant at $52.00 and the configurable parent at 0.0000), and there is no evidence the green variants or all sizes were updated by -$5. Therefore the requested price reduction was not performed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compute accurate per‑unit price): I will not use this now. It's for converting multi-pack prices to per‑unit; this task is a straightforward price update on a single product across sizes, not comparing pack/unit prices.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Compute accurate per‑unit price..." — Not relevant for this task. We're changing a fixed dollar amount on a single product across sizes, not comparing per-unit prices. I will not use this memory now.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (compute per‑unit price): Not relevant — we're editing simple product prices directly, not comparing pack/unit prices.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (compute per‑unit price): Not needed — this task is a straight price edit for single‑item SKUs, no multi‑pack or unit conversions involved.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compute accurate per‑unit price): NOT using — this task is a straight $5 reduction on unit prices of product variants, no pack/multi‑unit price conversions needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Compute accurate per‑unit price..." — I will not use this memory for this step because we are making a flat $5 reduction to the displayed product price, not comparing per‑unit prices or handling multi‑packs.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compute accurate per‑unit price): I will not use this — it's for converting pack/multi‑pack pricing to per‑unit; we're editing single-item product prices directly.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (compute per‑unit price): NOT USE — irrelevant for this task (we're changing a simple $ price, not packing/unit calculations).
===============INFO - We need to update the price for all sizes of "Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt" by decreasing $5. To target only those items, I'll narrow the product list to just the Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt items first.
