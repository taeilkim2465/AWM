## Intent

Open my latest created issue that has homepage content in its title to check if it is closed

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to open their latest-created issue whose title contains the phrase "homepage content" and check if it is closed. The agent searched for "homepage content" and opened issue #11522, whose title (visible in the snapshot) is "homepage property in package.json breaking the aceess to the css files in the public folder." That title contains "homepage" but not the exact phrase "homepage content." Because the agent did not open an issue whose title contains the requested phrase, it did not fulfill the user's specified condition—even though it correctly opened #11522 and showed its status is Open. Therefore the task requirements were not met. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I opened the most recent matching issue: #11522 — \"homepage property in package.json breaking the aceess to the css files in the public folder.\" Current status: Open. Note: its title contains \"homepage\" but not the exact phrase \"homepage content.\" What would you like me to do next? (Options: close the issue, search again for the exact phrase \"homepage content\", open another match, or something else.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter/sort by creation date to pick newest): I will use this — it's exactly what we need to find the most recently created issue matching the keyword.
===============INFO - I will search the issues list for titles containing "homepage content" and open the most recently created matching issue.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it advises filtering/sorting by creation date and selecting the newest match — useful once I can see matching issues. I will use Memory 2 because after opening an item I should report its title and open/closed status and offer next steps. I will not use Memory 3 (verify public profile) because it's unrelated.
===============INFO - I will consider the stored memories before taking action.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — relevant. It recommends selecting the newest item matching the keyword; I used that approach to open the most recent matching issue.
