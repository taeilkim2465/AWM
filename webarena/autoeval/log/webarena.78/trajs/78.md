## Intent

What is the total count of Approved reviews amongst all the reviews?

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows the Status filter set to "Approved" and the grid displays "346 records found" with pagination set to 20 per page and "1 of 18" pages (17 full pages × 20 = 340 plus 6 on the last page = 346). The agent correctly reported the total Approved reviews as 346.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'There are 346 Approved reviews. The grid shows "346 records found" with Status=Approved (20 per page, 18 pages total → 17*20 + 6 = 346

===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they remind me to check all pages of reviews (pagination) and ensure the count aggregates across the entire dataset rather than just the visible page:
===============INFO - Memory 1, 2, and 3 (about exhaustively handling pagination and aggregating across all records) are relevant and I will use them — I need to ensure the Approved count covers every review page, not just the visible page.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they remind me to handle pagination and ensure the count covers all records, not just the visible page:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to check pagination. I see "346 records found" and the pager shows "20 per page" and "1 of 18", so pagination matches a total of 346 (17 full pages of 20 = 340, plus 6 on the last page = 346).
