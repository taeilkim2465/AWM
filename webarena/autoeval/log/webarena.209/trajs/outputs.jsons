{"id": 209, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for customer name and email for phone 2137418080. The agent located the customer record (Jennifer White) and the phone number is visible on the page. The email address is not shown in the current view; the agent explicitly stated the email is not visible and offered to open the \"Account Information\" section to retrieve it. Because the agent either provided the requested info that is available and clearly indicated the email is not available in the current view (with a next-step offer), this meets the information-seeking success criteria.", "status": "success"}}
