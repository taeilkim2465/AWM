{"id": 366, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user wanted the walking distance between the nearest CVS and UPMC Shadyside. The action history shows repeated attempts to fill in origins/destinations and selecting \"Foot (OSRM)\", but the final webpage snapshot only shows the OpenStreetMap welcome screen and a regional map with no route polyline, directions panel, or distance displayed. Because the page does not show any computed walking route or distance (and the agent's response did not provide the distance), the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
