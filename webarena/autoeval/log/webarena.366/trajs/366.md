## Intent

Measure distance between CVS (closet one) and UPMC Shadyside by walking

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted the walking distance between the nearest CVS and UPMC Shadyside. The action history shows repeated attempts to fill in origins/destinations and selecting "Foot (OSRM)", but the final webpage snapshot only shows the OpenStreetMap welcome screen and a regional map with no route polyline, directions panel, or distance displayed. Because the page does not show any computed walking route or distance (and the agent's response did not provide the distance), the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the memories because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (choose walking routing profile) — I will use this. The user asked for walking distance, so I must ensure the routing profile is set to walking.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the walking routing profile for pedestrian distance): I will use this — the user asked for walking distance and the page already shows Foot (OSRM), so I should confirm we keep walking mode.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the walking routing profile) — I will use this. The route mode must be walking so the distance/time are pedestrian-appropriate; the page already shows "Foot (OSRM)" selected, so I should keep that.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the walking routing profile): I will use this — the route must be calculated with the walking (pedestrian) profile.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it reminds me to confirm the routing profile is set to walking. The page shows "Foot (OSRM)" selected, so I will proceed with that profile.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (choose walking profile) — I will use this. The user asked for walking distance, so I must ensure the routing profile is set to walking.
