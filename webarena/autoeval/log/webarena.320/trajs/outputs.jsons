For the user's question about expected refund including shipping it gave the two correct outcomes (full refund $231.54 if shipping refunded, or $226.54 if shipping is non\u2011refundable), noted assumptions, and offered concrete follow-up actions to confirm the actual refund. This satisfies an information-seeking task by providing the requested refund amounts and clarifying uncertainty/next steps.", "status": "success"}}
