How much refund I should expect from my order canlled in Feb 2023, including shipping fee

## RM

Thoughts: The agent retrieved the order page details and reported the visible amounts (item subtotal $226.54, shipping $5.00, grand total $231.54). For the user's question about expected refund including shipping it gave the two correct outcomes (full refund $231.54 if shipping refunded, or $226.54 if shipping is non‑refundable), noted assumptions, and offered concrete follow-up actions to confirm the actual refund. This satisfies an information-seeking task by providing the requested refund amounts and clarifying uncertainty/next steps.
Status: "success"
