## Intent

Find the customer name and email with phone number 2065555555

## RM

Thoughts: The table in the page snapshot shows customer ID 25 with Name "Adam Garcia", Phone "2065555555", and Email "gamingpro456@gmail.com", which matches the agent's reported result and fulfills the user's request to find the customer's name and email for that phone number.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Found customer with phone 2065555555:\n- Name: Adam Garcia\n- Email: gamingpro456@gmail.com\n- Customer ID: 25\n\nWould you like me to open this customer's record or run a search/filter for other matching phone formats?"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use page find/search to quickly locate the identifier. I will use this memory later after opening the Customers area to search for the phone number on the customer record page. (Will use: yes.)
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. It suggests using the page find and checking likely fields (billing/contact/account) which will be useful once we open the customer list or a customer record.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Search targeted fields / page find): I will use this — it matches the approach I used to locate the phone number in the customers table.
