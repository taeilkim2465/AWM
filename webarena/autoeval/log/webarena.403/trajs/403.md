## Intent

Change my reddit bio to "Awesome Prompt Artist"

## RM

Thoughts: The editing page shows the Biography field and Preview set to "Awesome Prompt Artist" and a green confirmation message at bottom-left reading "The biography was updated." This indicates the save completed and the user's bio was changed as requested.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to save profile changes and verify the public profile—important after editing the bio. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 right now because those are about offering follow-up choices after presenting results; that's not needed until after I update and confirm the bio.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to click the explicit save/submit control after editing and to verify the public profile shows the new bio — that will be needed after I enter the new biography. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because those are about offering follow-up choices after route/report results, which don't apply to editing a profile bio.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It reminds me to click the explicit Save control and then verify the public profile shows the updated bio — both are relevant here.
