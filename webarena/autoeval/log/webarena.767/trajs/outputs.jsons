The search on the map returned \"No results found\" and the agent only asked a clarification question about the meaning of \"locally\u2011owned chain\" and whether the user wants walking directions; it did not provide the closest locally\u2011owned chain grocery, verify ownership, or give a walking route (nor did it explicitly report that no suitable stores exist). Because the required information/directions were not delivered or explicitly declared unavailable, this attempt is a failure.", "status": "failure"}}
