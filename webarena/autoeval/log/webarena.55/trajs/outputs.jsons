{"id": 55, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for walking time between Starbucks near CMU and Chatham University. Although the agent filled the origin (\"Starbucks, 5000 Forbes Ave...\"), destination, and selected \"Foot (OSRM)\", the final page snapshot still only shows the directions input panel and a \"Go\" button with no route, duration, or directions displayed (map is zoomed out). There is no evidence the walking time was computed or returned to the user, so the information-seeking task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
