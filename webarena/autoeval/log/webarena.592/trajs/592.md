## Intent

Create a milestone for the upcoming task of cleaning sensitive information starting on 2/16/2023 and ending on in 20 days

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent filled the title ("Cleaning sensitive information"), start date 2023-02-16, calculated and filled the end date 2023-03-07 (consistent with a 20-day inclusive duration), added the description, and created the milestone. The final webpage snapshot confirms the milestone exists with title, start Feb 16, 2023 and due Mar 7, 2023 (marked past due). This matches the user's request to create the milestone starting 2/16/2023 with a 20-day span.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Done — I created the milestone:\n- Title: Cleaning sensitive information\n- Start date: Feb 16, 2023 (inclusive

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the provided memories to interpret the dates precisely:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The user supplied an explicit start date (2/16/2023), so I will treat that date as inclusive when computing the end/due date.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items to avoid off-by-one or vague date interpretation errors.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Treat an explicitly provided start date as inclusive" — I will use this. The user gave 2/16/2023 as the start, so I treated Feb 16 as day 1 when computing the 20-day interval.
