## Intent

Add this product to my wishlist

## RM

Thoughts: The page snapshot shows a green success banner explicitly stating the iPhone 13 Pro Max case was added to your Wish List and the My Wish List page displays items (Items 1 to 10 of 13), confirming the item appears in the wishlist. The agent followed the product detail → wishlist flow and reported the correct result. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I used the saved guidance (use product detail page → wishlist control

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it recommends the reliable sequence (find product → open product detail → use wishlist control). I'll follow that approach if we need to add another product.
