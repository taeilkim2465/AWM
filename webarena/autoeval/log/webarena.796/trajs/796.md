## Intent

Change the delivery address for my most recent order to 155 5th Street, San Francisco, CA.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to change the delivery address for their most recent order to 155 5th Street, San Francisco, CA. The action history and final page show the agent ended on the My Account / Address Book view; the Default Shipping Address still shows "222 Redwood Rise, Suite 300, Seattle, Washington, 98101" and there is no visible edit or order-specific address change. There is no evidence the order's delivery address was modified (no navigation to an order details page or confirmation of an address update). Therefore the task was not completed.

Status: "failure"

I will not use Memory 3 right now (it’s useful later if I need to present billing/address metadata to you).
