{"id": 550, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The action log only shows navigation and a search for \"size\" (fill('747','size')) and a click, with the final screenshot showing the attributes list page (and \"Add New Attribute\" button). There is no action opening the size attribute's options, no addition of a new option \"XXS\", no selection of the Nona Fitness Tank product or its blue/purple variants, and no save/confirmation step. Therefore the requested change (adding XXS to the blue and purple Nona Fitness Tank) was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
