## Intent

Add a new size XXS to blue and purple Nona Fitness Tank

## RM

Thoughts: The action log only shows navigation and a search for "size" (fill('747','size')) and a click, with the final screenshot showing the attributes list page (and "Add New Attribute" button). There is no action opening the size attribute's options, no addition of a new option "XXS", no selection of the Nona Fitness Tank product or its blue/purple variants, and no save/confirmation step. Therefore the requested change (adding XXS to the blue and purple Nona Fitness Tank) was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 for this task.
===============INFO - Memory review before proceeding:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify the option was added ...) — I will use this. After adding a size I must verify it appears in the product's variant list, and if not, re-open configuration or adjust attribute scope.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Verify the option was added..." — I will use this memory because after adding XXS I must immediately confirm it appears for the intended variants (Blue and Purple). I'll check the variant list after adding.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - We need to add size "XXS" specifically to the blue and purple variants of the Nona Fitness Tank. That likely requires editing the product (a configurable product) and adjusting its configurations/variants rather than only adding an option globally in Attributes — or if the size option doesn't exist globally, we may need to add it to the Size attribute first and then add the variant to the product.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Verify the option was added) because after adding a size I should immediately check the variants to confirm the new option appears where expected. I will note Memory 2 (Set the variant scope) but not apply it yet — it may be needed after I open the size attribute to ensure the option is added at the correct scope. I will not use Memory 3 (slot dimensions) because it's unrelated.
