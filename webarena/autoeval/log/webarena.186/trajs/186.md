## Intent

Give me the product names and the sizes of the products that have 2-3 units left

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot shows two products with "Default Stock: 2" and "Default Stock: 3" respectively, and their names include the sizes ("Eos V-Neck Hoodie-S-Blue" → S, "Minerva LumaTech™ V-Tee-XS-Blue" → XS). The agent's response correctly listed both product names and sizes for items with 2–3 units left, so the information-seeking task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Products with 2–3 units left:\n- Eos V-Neck Hoodie — Size: S (listed as \"Eos V-Neck Hoodie-S-Blue\", Default Stock: 2
