## Intent

Compare the difference in time for walking and driving route from Randyland to Carnegie Mellon University

## RM

Thoughts: The Directions panel in the final snapshot shows only the Foot (OSRM) route with "Distance: 7.8km. Time: 1:45." Although the action history toggled the mode several times (Foot/Car), the final page does not show the Car (driving) travel time nor any computed difference between walking and driving. Because the user asked for a comparison of walking vs driving times and the agent did not provide the driving time or the difference, the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use the memory items because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use walking-mode routing and compare walking distance/time — I will use this (important for realistic walking estimates).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use walking-mode routing): YES — the page already shows a walking route (Foot (OSRM)) with Distance: 7.8km, Time: 1:45, so I'll keep that walking result as the walking estimate.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to use walking-mode for the walking estimate; the page already shows Foot (OSRM) result (1:45), so I'll keep that as the walking reference.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows before taking action:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use walking-mode routing and compare walking time — YES. The page already shows the walking result (Distance: 7.8km. Time: 1:45), so I'll keep that as the walking baseline.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use walking-mode routing and compare walking distance/time — I will use this (yes) because the user specifically asked for walking vs driving times.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use? Yes. It reminds me to use the walking profile for the walking estimate — the page is already showing Foot (OSRM) with Distance: 7.8km, Time: 1:45, so I will keep that as the walking value.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it tells me to use walking-mode routing and compare walking time/route, which is exactly needed.
