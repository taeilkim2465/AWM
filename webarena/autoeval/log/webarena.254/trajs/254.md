What is the phone number of Western Pennsylvania Hospital

## RM

Thoughts: The Nominatim search page in the final snapshot shows only a blank map and no search result details or contact information for "Western Pennsylvania Hospital." The action history shows repeated searches/clicks but no navigation to a page displaying a phone number. For an information-seeking task the agent must return the phone number or explicitly state it's unavailable; neither is present in the final state. Therefore the task failed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will not apply any phone-number normalization yet (Memory 3) because I first need to locate any contact info on the page. I won't use the phone-format retry guidance (Memory 2) right now — that only matters after a number is found. I will keep Memory 1 in mind: if I can't find a phone number, I'll report which areas I checked (header, contact form, footer, account/help links) and give next-step options.
