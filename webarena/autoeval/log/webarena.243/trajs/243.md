## Intent

Show me the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with Circe fleece

Thoughts: The final page shows a 1‑star review for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" with the author listed as "Guest" and name "Hannah Lim" and the review text "Bad!", but there is no email address visible anywhere on the snapshot. Because the user asked specifically for the customer's email and the page does not display an email (and appears to be a guest review), the agent did not provide the requested information or an explicit statement that the email is unavailable.
Status: "failure"
