## Intent

Create a new forum named sci_fi, with a description of A wild place for sci-fi enthusiasts, and include ['New', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'Post my novel', 'Random'] in the sidebar?

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot shows the new forum at /f/sci_fi with the sidebar titled "sci_fi" and the bullet list containing "New", "Classic", "Movies", "Post my novel", and "Random". It also shows "Created 1 second ago", indicating the form submission succeeded. These match the user's requested forum name and sidebar items (description entry was submitted), so the creation was successful.
Status: "success"
