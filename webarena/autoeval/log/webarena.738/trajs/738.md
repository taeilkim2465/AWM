## Intent

Show me the way from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of Philadelphia 76ers in the 70th

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled origin and destination (Carnegie Mellon University → Wells Fargo Center), requested directions, and returned a clear driving-summary (distance 495 km, time 5:52) with key route and noted that full turn-by-turn directions are available. The webpage snapshot shows the route and turn-by-turn list. This meets the user's request to "show me the way," so the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I found driving directions from Carnegie Mellon University to Wells Fargo Center (home of the Philadelphia 76ers
