## Intent

I have a lot of Nintendo Switch game cards now, help me find the best storage option to fit all 23 cards

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for "Nintendo Switch game card case" and opened a product page that clearly states it holds up to 24 game cards (and 24 micro SD cards). That directly satisfies the user's need to store 23 cards. The final page shows sufficient capacity, so the agent found a suitable option.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the saved memories to guide the search:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify capacity and internal layout on product pages): I will use this — I need to open product detail pages to confirm stated slot count and internal layout so I can be sure a candidate will hold all 23 cards.
