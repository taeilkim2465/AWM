## Intent

Tell me the number of commits of the contributor who has the most commits to branch main

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task asking for the top contributor's commit count on branch "main". The agent only read and reported the stats for the currently shown branch, which is "master" (screenshot shows the branch selector set to master and Vinta Chen with 414 commits). The agent did not switch the branch to "main" or provide the requested information for "main" (it only offered to switch if the user wanted). Therefore the agent failed to deliver the requested information for branch main.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they both say to open the repository's Contributors/Insights view (or API) to get authoritative per-contributor commit counts — that's exactly what the user asked for. I will not use Memory 2 because it concerns repository access lists, which are irrelevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Open the project's Contributors/Insights view to read each contributor's commit total" — I will use this (yes). It's the authoritative place to get per-contributor commit counts.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they recommend opening the repository's Contributors / Insights view to get authoritative per-contributor commit counts — that's exactly what we need to answer who has the most commits on a branch. I will not use Memory 2 because it's about repository access, which is irrelevant for commit counts.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Contributors view provides authoritative per-contributor commit counts" — I will use this. The page I'm viewing is the repository's Contributors view, which directly lists commit totals.
