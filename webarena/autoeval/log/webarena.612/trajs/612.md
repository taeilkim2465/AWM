## Intent

Post a review of my recent reading "big little lies" in the r/books with my comment "can't stop it".

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked the agent to post the review to r/books. The agent filled the Title and Body, selected the forum, and attempted submission, but the page displays a clear error: "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The agent informed the user and offered retry/draft/alternate-account options, but did not complete the post. Final page shows the form still filled and the blocking message, so the submission was not made.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "The site is blocking submissions right now — the page shows: \"You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.\" I won't attempt to submit again immediately.\n\nYour filled fields: Title = \"Review: Big Little Lies\", Body = \"can't stop it\", Forum = r/books.\n\nOptions you can choose from:\n- Wait and retry later: I can retry submitting for you after a delay or at intervals (I recommend exponential/backoff retries

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Detect and handle posting rate limits) as a precaution: if the site later returns a rate-limit or "can't post now" error, I should stop retrying and inform you with recovery options. Memory 2 and Memory 3 are not relevant to creating a new submission, so I will not use them now.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (rate limits) as a caution: if submission fails later with a rate-limit, I should stop retries and notify the user. I will not actively apply it right now but will keep it in mind.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Detect and handle posting rate limits): I will use this. The page clearly shows "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." Trying to submit again now would likely fail; I should present recovery options (wait and retry later with backoff, save draft, or use a different account) instead of retrying blindly.

The site doesn't show an ETA, so I can't give an exact retry time.\n- Keep/save a draft: the form is still filled on the page, so you can keep this tab open as a draft. I can also copy the title/body here in chat so you can save them locally.\n- Use a different account: log in with another account and I can try to submit from that account.\n\nWhat would you like me to do? If you want me to retry later, tell me how often to try (e.g., every 5 minutes) and for how long, or choose one of the other options.")
