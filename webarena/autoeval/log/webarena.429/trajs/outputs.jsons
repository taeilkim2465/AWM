The action history shows repeated searches and clicks for both universities, but the final snapshot is just the generic OpenStreetMap view with the welcome modal open and no place details, info panels, or dedicated pages for either college visible. Because the agent did not end on the specific place pages or a map page clearly showing the colleges' place details, the navigation did not reach the requested pages.", "status": "failure"}}
