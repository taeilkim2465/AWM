## Intent

Find the page of the colleges where The Chair was filmed in Pittsburgh on the map.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to find the page of the colleges where The Chair was filmed in Pittsburgh (University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon) on the map. The action history shows repeated searches and clicks for both universities, but the final snapshot is just the generic OpenStreetMap view with the welcome modal open and no place details, info panels, or dedicated pages for either college visible. Because the agent did not end on the specific place pages or a map page clearly showing the colleges' place details, the navigation did not reach the requested pages.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Record provenance and exact quotes) is not relevant to this task — I'm locating college map pages, not extracting reviewer quotes, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - I'll use memories about searching institutions directly (Memory 2 and Memory 3) because they are relevant: the user asked for college pages on the map, and those memories recommend searching for the institution name to get the college's map/profile page. Memory 1 (record provenance and exact quotes) is not relevant to this map search, so I will not use it.
