## Intent

Start a private project AGISite with JEKYLL template and add Rohan and Vinta as members

## RM

Thoughts: The AGISite project was created (project name visible in the UI), but the invite step failed — the "Invite members" modal shows a validation error "Please add members to invite" and the Username field contains the plain text "Rohan, Vinta" without actually selecting users (Invite button is disabled). Because the members were not properly added/invited, the user's full intent (create private JEKYLL project and add Rohan and Vinta) was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. I will verify the chosen JEKYLL template is applied and that the repo is blank (or remove sample files) after creating the project.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I'll verify the chosen JEKYLL template is applied and that the repo is blank after creation (check template indicator and initial files).
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this later to verify the Jekyll template was actually applied and that the repo is blank (so: YES, use later).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ensure the chosen template is applied and the repo is truly blank): I will use this — after creating the project I will verify the template indicator and check initial files. This is relevant later, but I note it now so I remember to verify after creation.
===============INFO - Memory usage decisions:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ensure the chosen template is applied and the repo is truly blank): I will use this memory later after creating the project to verify the Jekyll template was applied and that the repository contents match the "blank" expectation. For now, creation must proceed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Ensure the chosen template is applied and the repo is truly blank" — I will use this memory. The page already shows Jekyll files (README.md, index.html, _config.yml, etc.), so the Jekyll template was applied and the repo is not blank. I'll still confirm visually by opening the project information/members area afterwards.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ensure the chosen template is applied and the repo is truly blank): I will not use this memory now — it concerns confirming a template/repo contents after project creation, but we're already on the Members page and the task now is to add members.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Ensure the chosen template is applied and the repo is truly blank" — I will NOT use this memory now because we are at the final step (adding members). Verifying the template / repo contents is a separate check and would require navigating to the repository view; the user asked specifically to add members as the last step.
