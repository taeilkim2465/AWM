{"id": 321, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked how much refund to expect including shipping for a canceled 2022 order (information-seeking). The agent retrieved the order page, extracted the order totals (Item Subtotal $2,111.32, Shipping $15.00, Grand Total $2,126.32) and clearly presented two refund scenarios: full refund including shipping ($2,126.32) and items-only refund ($2,111.32), plus relevant caveats about taxes, discounts, and refund method. The page snapshot and the agent's summary are consistent, and the agent either provided the requested amount (including shipping) or explained uncertainty and next steps. This meets the information-seeking success criteria.", "status": "success"}}
