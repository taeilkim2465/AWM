How much refund I should expect from my order canlled in 2022, including shipping fee

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked how much refund to expect including shipping for a canceled 2022 order (information-seeking). The agent retrieved the order page, extracted the order totals (Item Subtotal $2,111.32, Shipping $15.00, Grand Total $2,126.32) and clearly presented two refund scenarios: full refund including shipping ($2,126.32) and items-only refund ($2,111.32), plus relevant caveats about taxes, discounts, and refund method. The page snapshot and the agent's summary are consistent, and the agent either provided the requested amount (including shipping) or explained uncertainty and next steps. This meets the information-seeking success criteria. 
Status: "success"

This equals the grand total shown on the order.\n\n2) Items-only refund (shipping non-refundable): $2,111.32\n   - Assumption: Only the item subtotal is refunded; shipping ($15.00) is not refunded.\n\nNotes and caveats:\n- I don’t see any taxes or discounts listed on the order page; if there were taxes/discounts they would change the totals.\n- Because payment was Check/Money order, the refund method or timing may differ (e.g., refund by check or store credit and could take longer to process).\n- Since the order status is Canceled, many stores issue the full refund, but policies vary (some may withhold shipping or apply restocking fees). If you want a definitive amount, contact the store’s customer service or check their refund policy and provide this order number.\n\nWould you like me to open the store’s refund/returns policy or prepare a message to customer service using these details?")
