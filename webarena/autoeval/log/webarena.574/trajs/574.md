## Intent

I recently moved, my address is 111 Magnolia Path, Atlanta, GA, 30303, update my information on OneStopShopping accordingly

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the address fields were filled (111 Magnolia Path, Georgia, Atlanta, 30303) and the save button clicked. The page snapshot shows a green confirmation banner "You saved the address." and both Default Billing and Default Shipping addresses display "111 Magnolia Path, Atlanta, Georgia, 30303", so the update was applied successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will navigate to the account area so I can find the address or profile settings to update your address.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It applies to "view my items" pages, but here we need to update the user's address, so I'll go to the address management area instead.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the dedicated list page for "view my items" requests): Not relevant — this request is to update an address, and the Address Book page is already open.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (Report the updated address plus key order metadata after saving) because after I save the change I should confirm the new address to the user. I will not use Memory 1 (dedicated list page) because this task is editing the address on the Address Book page, not viewing a list. I will not use Memory 3 (map search) because the user provided the full address and ZIP; no lookup is needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (go straight to a dedicated list page) is not relevant for editing an address, so I will not use it.
