{"id": 34, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent found and reported a nearby Hyatt (Hyatt Place Pittsburgh Airport, Campbells Run Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15244). It attempted to compute walking directions but the routing returned a clearly incorrect long-distance result (~701 km to near New York). The agent explicitly stated it could not confidently give a shortest walking time and offered clear next steps (retry with specific supermarkets or use another mapping service). Because the response either provides the requested hotel name and explicitly explains why the walking-time info is unavailable, this meets the information-seeking success criteria.", "status": "success"}}
