## Intent

List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about average print quality

## RM

Thoughts: The page snapshot clearly shows the review titled "Never buying Epson again." by Roxanne Brandon Coffey containing the sentence "The print quality was average." The agent's message lists that reviewer, provides the exact quote, and gives a verifiable source (review title, reviewer name, date, review index). That satisfies the information-seeking task requirement, so the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Reviewers who mention ‘average’ print quality:\n\n- Roxanne Brandon Coffey — exact quote: \"The print quality was average.\" — Source: Reviews section, page 1, review titled \"Never buying Epson again.\" (Review by Roxanne Brandon Coffey, Posted on 4/20/23
