===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they advise keeping discussion posts concise and directly actionable, which matches the user's request for a very short prompt ("your opinion"). I will not use Memory 3 because it concerns geographic queries and isn't relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it says keep discussion posts concise; the user requested a very short prompt, so I'll keep the body minimal.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Keep discussion posts concise and directly actionable): I will use this — the user asked for a very short prompt, so a minimal body ("your opinion") is appropriate.
