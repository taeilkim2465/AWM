Thoughts: The agent set the Period to Year, filled the From and To dates for 2023, clicked to generate the report, and returned a top-5 best-selling products list with order counts. The response contains the requested information (top-5 for 2023) and no error or missing-step is evident from the action history and page snapshot. Therefore the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they both instruct to run the best-sellers report with an explicit from/to date range and appropriate period granularity for the year 2023 — that is exactly what we need to produce top-5 best-sellers for 2023. I will not use Memory 3 right now (fallback suggestions) because I expect the reports area will contain the bestsellers report and allow setting date filters; fallback options are only needed if the report has no results.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they instruct to set the report date range and period explicitly to the year's start/end and to choose the correct granularity — these are directly relevant to getting the top sellers for 2023. I will keep Memory 3 in mind as a fallback (useful if the report returns no results), but I won't apply it yet.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It recommends setting the report's date range to Jan 1–Dec 31 for the target year. The page shows the From and To fields set to 1/1/23–12/31/23, so this memory is applicable.
