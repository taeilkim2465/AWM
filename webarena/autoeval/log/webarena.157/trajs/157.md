## Intent

Show all customers

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to "Show all customers." The final page is the Magento Customers grid showing "0 records found" and the message "We couldn't find any records." The grid is set to show up to 100 per page and there are no filters/search terms visible, so the UI explicitly reports that there are no customers to display. This fulfills the user's request (the result is that there are no customers).
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1, Memory 2, or Memory 3 because they relate to inferring customer appeal from product attributes or handling product reviews — those are not relevant to the user's request to "Show all customers" in the Magento admin. The appropriate next step is to navigate to the Customers area of the admin.
