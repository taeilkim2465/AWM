## Intent

Show the most recent cancelled order

## RM

Thoughts: The final page displayed is the order details for Order #000000170 and clearly shows the status "Canceled" with the order date (May 17, 2023) and the items ordered. The action sequence (clicks) led to the cancelled order details view, satisfying the user's request to show the most recent cancelled order.
Status: "success"
