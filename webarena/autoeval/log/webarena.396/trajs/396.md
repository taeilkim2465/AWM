## Intent

Fork ChatGPT.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to fork "ChatGPT". The agent searched the current GitLab instance (search query "ChatGPT Reasoning Memories") and the page shows no matching projects. The agent then informed the user it couldn't find the project and offered next steps (search public GitLab/GitHub, give instructions, or initiate OAuth). The agent did not perform a fork nor confirm the repo location or complete an OAuth flow, so the requested fork was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I can’t find a project named "ChatGPT Reasoning Memories" on this GitLab instance. I won’t ask for your credentials. Which of these would you like me to do next?\n\n1

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Don't request user credentials) to avoid asking for the user's login and to offer alternatives if needed — so I will not request credentials and will instead try to locate the repository so you can confirm which repo to fork or follow a step-by-step fork flow.

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (don't request credentials) — USE: Forking requires authentication. I will not ask for credentials. I'll look for the repository so you can confirm which one to fork or I can give step-by-step instructions / request an OAuth flow if you want me to perform the fork.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Don't request user credentials) — Use. This is relevant: forking needs authentication, so I should not ask for raw credentials and should offer safe alternatives.
