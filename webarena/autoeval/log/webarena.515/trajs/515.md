## Intent

Add a white computer desk to my wish list.

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a green confirmation banner reading "EMMA + OLIVER White Computer Desk with Keyboard Tray and Drawers has been added to your Wish List," and the My Wish List page is displayed (9 items). The action history (search, add, view wish list) matches this result, so the requested item was added successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they are directly relevant: I need to refine the search to a concrete product and follow the sequence search → open item → add to wish list. I will not use Memory 2 because the user asked to add an item to the wish list (not to view the wish list), so opening the dedicated list page is unnecessary right now.
===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide my action:
