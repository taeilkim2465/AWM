## Intent

Tell me the the number of reviews that our store received by far that mention term "best"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied a filter for "best", confirmed the Reviews grid shows "2 records found" and pagination is 1 of 1. The provided screenshot clearly displays "2 records found" and two review rows (IDs 199 and 73), so the agent correctly reported the count as 2.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'I checked the Reviews list (Review filter = \"best\"

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (exhaustively traverse paginated reviews): I will use this — there may be multiple pages of reviews, so I should check pagination before concluding the count.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Exhaustively traverse paginated reviews): I will use this — to be sure the count is complete I need to check all review pages or determine total pages before reporting the final number.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I'll ensure search results are treated thoroughly (after filtering I'll check the reported records count and, if needed, iterate pages).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will follow the guidance to ensure all pages were checked before concluding. The page shows "of 1", so there is only one page to scan.
