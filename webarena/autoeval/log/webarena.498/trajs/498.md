## Intent

Update order #306 with the UPS tracking number 55591023930

## RM

Thoughts: The agent selected United Parcel Service and filled a tracking value, but the tracking field contains an extra trailing '#' (entered '55591023930#' not the exact number). The last page shows a confirmation modal "Are you sure you want to send a Shipment email to customer?" so the agent has not completed the final confirmation/save step. There is no visible evidence the tracking number was saved to the order. Because the tracking number was entered incorrectly and the final confirmation/save was not completed, the update was not successfully performed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this if the system prevents adding tracking (e.g., order canceled or not shippable). If that happens, I will surface the restriction and ask if you want to override/reopen or cancel the request and explain consequences.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ask for explicit confirmation when the order status blocks shipment updates): I will use this. The current page shows order 000000307 with status "Canceled"; if the order we find is canceled I must ask you whether to proceed (reopen/override) before adding tracking.

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ask for explicit confirmation when order status blocks shipment updates): I will not use this now because the page shows "The shipment has been created." and the shipments tab is accessible, so the system already allowed shipment creation. If the system later prevents editing tracking, I'll surface that and ask the user how to proceed.
