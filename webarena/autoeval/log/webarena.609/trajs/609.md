## Intent

Find a subreddit focused on topics related to ML, DL, NLP, and post my question, "what is the SOTA web navigation agent repo" there

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to a subreddit submission form (the MachineLearning forum) and filled the Title and Body with the user's question, but the page shows a red error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The agent explicitly reported it could not submit the post and offered alternatives. Because the post was not actually submitted (content modification did not occur), the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I can’t submit the post here right now — the site shows “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.” How would you like to proceed?\n\nOptions:\n1
