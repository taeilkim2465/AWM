## Intent

Set my gitlab status as Resting due to leg injury.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent entered the status text ("Resting due to leg injury.") and clicked, but then immediately asked the user whether to include an emoji and how long the status should remain—so it did not complete setting the GitLab status.

===============INFO - Memory items about routing queries are not relevant to updating a GitLab user status, so I will not use Memory 1, Memory 2, or Memory 3.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will not use any of the memory items because they describe how to handle multi-leg routing queries (unrelated to changing a GitLab status).
===============INFO - I will not use any of the stored memory items because they all describe splitting multi-leg routing queries, which is unrelated to setting a GitLab status.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it's about routing queries for multi-leg trips, which doesn't apply to setting a GitLab status.
