## Intent

Tell me the email address, name, phone number of the customer who has the most cancellations in the history

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only filtered orders by Status: Canceled (142 records) and opened the export dialog; the visible orders table shows bill-to names but no email or phone and there is no evidence the agent aggregated cancellations by customer to find who has the most. The agent did not navigate to a customer record or provide the requested email/phone/name for the top-canceling customer. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It reminds me to open a customer record and inspect contact/billing/account sections and subtables for canonical phone/email — likely needed once I find the customer with the most cancellations.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to open the full customer record and inspect contact/billing/account sections and subtables for canonical email/phone once I locate the customer with most cancellations.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. Once I find the customer with the most canceled orders, I need to open their full record and inspect contact/billing/account sections and subtables to get canonical email and phone entries.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because after I identify the customer with the most cancellations I need to open that customer's record and inspect contact/billing/account sections and subtables to get the canonical email and phone (these memories remind me to check multiple sections for alternate phone/email entries). I will not use Memory 3 because it’s about repository commit counts and not relevant to orders/customers.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because after I identify the customer with the most cancellations I will need to open that customer's record and check contact/billing/account sections and subtables to get the canonical email and phone number. I will not use Memory 3 (it's about repository contributors and not relevant).
===============INFO - Memory 1 and Memory 2 will be useful: once I identify the customer with the most cancellations, I should open their customer record and inspect contact/billing/account sections and subtables to get the canonical email and phone. So I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items that help when I open a customer record to confirm contact details, but I won't use the one about commit counts (irrelevant).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because after I find the customer with the most cancellations I must open their full customer record and check contact/billing/account sections (and subtables) to get canonical email and phone numbers. Memory 3 (contributors/commits) is irrelevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will need to open the winning customer's record and inspect contact/billing/account sections (and subtables) to find the canonical email and phone if they aren't in the order row.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I'll use this — after I identify the customer with the most cancellations, I should open their full record and inspect contact/billing/account sections and any subtables to confirm the canonical email and phone.
