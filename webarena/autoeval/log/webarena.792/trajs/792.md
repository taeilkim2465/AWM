## Intent

Buy the highest rated product from the Beauty & Personal Care category within a budget under 20.

## RM

Thoughts: The final page is the Beauty & Personal Care product page for "Roasamal Back Scrubber" showing a $6.99 price and a 5‑star rating, and a green banner states "You added Roasamal Back Scrubber..." while the cart overlay confirms items were added. The chosen item is in the requested category, is under $20, and has a top (5‑star) rating—so the agent successfully added a highest‑rated, in‑budget item to the cart.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 3, and not use Memory 2.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (choose highest rating first, then lowest price): I will use this — we must ensure we pick the product with the top rating among items under $20, then the cheapest within that top-rated group.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose by highest rating first, then lowest price): I will use this. It tells me to pick the item with the top rating among qualifying items and break ties by price.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - We need to buy the highest-rated product in Beauty & Personal Care under $20. I'll follow the remembered strategy: (1) apply category/price filters first to limit candidates (Memory 3) and (2) when multiple candidates qualify, pick the highest rating first, then the lowest price among those (Memory 1). I will not use Memory 2 because the user already specified the budget (< $20) and no recipient preferences are needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — Yes. I'll follow the rule to choose the highest rating first, then the cheapest among items with that top rating.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose by highest rating first, then lowest price among those): I will use this — it's exactly how I should pick the product (find the top rating among qualifying items, then choose the cheapest item with that rating).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It tells me to pick the highest rating first, then lowest price among ties. I will follow that rule when comparing candidate products.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I will follow the rule to first identify the highest rating among items within the budget, then pick the cheapest item among those with that top rating.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose by highest rating first, then lowest price among those): I will use this. I previously followed that rule to ensure we picked the highest-rated item in Beauty & Personal Care before proceeding. This product is within budget and shows a high rating, so we should continue with purchasing it.
