Thoughts: The agent returned Order ID 000000299 with Purchase Date May 31, 2023 2:55:09 AM. The screenshot shows order 000000299 at the top of the list with that exact purchase date and a "Pending" status, so the agent correctly identified the most recent pending order and provided the requested fields.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Most recent pending order — Order ID: 000000299; Purchase Date: May 31, 2023 2:55:09 AM.'
