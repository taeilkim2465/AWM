## Intent

I am doing a market survey for one stop market, show me the most expensive product from skin care tool category

## RM

Thoughts: The agent sorted the category by price, opened the top product page, and reported the product name, price ($1,799.95), availability (IN STOCK) and SKU (B07NDQKZV6). The final page snapshot clearly shows the same product title, price, SKU and stock status, so the requested information (most expensive item in Skin Care Tools) was found and reported. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Most expensive product in Skin Care Tools (found on One Stop Market

## Captions

===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (site search) right away — I'll try navigating the site's categories first because the main menu lists "Beauty & Personal Care". If that doesn't surface the Skin Care Tools category quickly I'll switch to the internal search.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (sort by price high-to-low) because that directly helps find the most expensive item. I will not use Memory 1 (search box) because we're looking within the "Skin Care" category and can sort the category results instead. I will not use Memory 2 (merchant/transaction filtering) because it's irrelevant to this product search.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use site's search) — not needed: the page already has category and price filters visible, and searching by brand isn't requested.
===============INFO - I will use the page results rather than the site search (Memory 1) because the Skin Care filter is already applied and the product prices are visible.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use site's search) — Not needed: the category page already lists the skin care tools.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the site's search box): I will not use this now — the product page for the top item is already open, so an internal search would be redundant.
