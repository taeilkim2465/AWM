## Intent

Today is 6/12/2023. Tell me how many fulfilled orders I have over the past year, and the total amount of money I spent.

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows the user's order list with several "Complete" (fulfilled) orders and their totals, and the agent set the page to show 50 items, but there is no evidence the agent filtered the date range to the past year or computed/summed the fulfilled orders. The snapshot only shows part of the list and the agent's actions did not include exporting, summing, or confirming that all orders within the past year are visible. The agent's response is not provided here and the page does not display a count or total spent for fulfilled orders, so the required information (number of fulfilled orders over the past year and total amount spent) was not clearly produced. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items about checking navigation badges because they suggest a quick way to find order counts before loading full lists — that may save time if a badge is present next to "Orders" or in the account navigation.
===============INFO - Memory 1-3: I will use these memories. They suggest checking navigation badges first to avoid loading full lists. I checked the account navigation/sidebar: there is a "My Orders" link but no visible badge/count next to it, so the badges don't provide the full answer. Therefore I should open the full orders list to get dates, statuses, and totals for the past year.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to check for counts/badges before loading full lists. I already see "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total", so this confirms there are 37 orders total and that I should show more per page to see all orders at once.
