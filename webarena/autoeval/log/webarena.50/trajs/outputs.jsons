{"id": 50, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The page shows the user's order list with several \"Complete\" (fulfilled) orders and their totals, and the agent set the page to show 50 items, but there is no evidence the agent filtered the date range to the past year or computed/summed the fulfilled orders. The snapshot only shows part of the list and the agent's actions did not include exporting, summing, or confirming that all orders within the past year are visible. The agent's response is not provided here and the page does not display a count or total spent for fulfilled orders, so the required information (number of fulfilled orders over the past year and total amount spent) was not clearly produced.", "status": "failure"}}
