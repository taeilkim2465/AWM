{"id": 672, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent needed to collect all review titles with ratings of 3 stars or less and then post them to r/games. The final page snapshot shows two reviews: \"It's good\" (4 stars \u2014 excluded) and \"Code not available!!\" (1 star \u2014 matches). However there is a pagination indicator (page 2) so additional \u22643-star reviews may exist but the action history/final state do not show those being collected. There's also no evidence the agent posted anything to the games subreddit. Because it did not fully gather all qualifying review titles (pagination not handled) and did not perform the subreddit post, the task is not completed successfully.", "status": "failure"}}
