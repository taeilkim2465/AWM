## Intent

Gather the titles of Nintendo Switch Fortnite Wildcat Console EU reviews with 3 stars and less rating from OneStopShop, and post them in the games subreddit under the title "real user feedback on Nintendo Switch Fortnite Wildcat Console EU"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent needed to collect all review titles with ratings of 3 stars or less and then post them to r/games. The final page snapshot shows two reviews: "It's good" (4 stars — excluded) and "Code not available!!" (1 star — matches). However there is a pagination indicator (page 2) so additional ≤3-star reviews may exist but the action history/final state do not show those being collected. There's also no evidence the agent posted anything to the games subreddit. Because it did not fully gather all qualifying review titles (pagination not handled) and did not perform the subreddit post, the task is not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory check:

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The page doesn't show a built-in review filter, so I'll follow Memory 1's guidance to paginate through the reviews and programmatically filter by rating (collect titles where rating is 3 stars or less).
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to guide this step, and ignore Memory 3.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use site review filters and confirm extraction targets — I WILL use this guidance. The site doesn't show a built-in review-filter control for star ranges, so I'll manually inspect each review's rating element and extract titles (summaries) with rating 3 stars or less as recommended.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use site review filters and confirm extraction targets): I will use this memory. It reminds me to apply filters if available and to ensure I extract the review titles (not metadata). The page already shows ratings next to each review and titles at the top of each review block, so I'll gather titles that match ratings <= 3 stars; I'll navigate pages to capture all reviews.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use site review filters and confirm extraction targets — I will use this. The guidance to paginate and focus on rating filters/selectors applies (the page has pagination and visible star ratings), so I'll paginate to Page 1 to collect additional reviews and then filter by ratings <= 3 stars.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use site review filters and confirm extraction targets — I will use this. The page has a rating display and pagination, so I should paginate through reviews (page 2) to capture all reviews with <=3 stars.
