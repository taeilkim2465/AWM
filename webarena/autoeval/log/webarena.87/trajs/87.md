## Intent

From my stay at red roof inn, what's the estimated driving time to reach Pittsburgh science museum?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent correctly asked the necessary clarifying questions (which Red Roof Inn, which museum, and traffic preference) but did not provide the requested driving-time estimate or state that the information is unavailable. For an information-seeking task, the agent must return the estimate or explicitly say it cannot; because the user’s location and target were not resolved and no estimate was given, the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

User Intent: From my stay at red roof inn, what's the estimated driving time to reach Pittsburgh science museum?

Action History:
1: send_msg_to_user("I can do that — before I calculate, I need two quick clarifications:\n1) Which Red Roof Inn do you mean? (please give the city or the hotel address/name — there are many Red Roof Inn locations)\n2) By “Pittsburgh science museum” do you mean the Carnegie Science Center, or a different museum? \nAlso, do you want an estimate with current traffic (if available) or a typical driving-time estimate? I will return both distance and estimated driving time and note the routing source and a traffic caveat.")
