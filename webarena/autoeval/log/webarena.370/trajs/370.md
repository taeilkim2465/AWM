## Intent

Pull up the description page of Carnegie Mellon University on Map

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot shows the OpenStreetMap search results panel with multiple Carnegie Mellon entries, not the university's description/detail page. The agent only filled the search box and clicked Go; it did not select a specific search result to open the description page. Therefore the requested description page was not pulled up.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (procedure for identifying the university with the most award winners) is not needed for this task — the user only asked to open Carnegie Mellon University's description page.
