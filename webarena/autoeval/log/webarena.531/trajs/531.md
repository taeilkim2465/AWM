## Intent

Draft a refund message via their "contact us" form for the phone case I bought March 2023. It broke after three days of use. The shop requires the order id, the reason and the amount to refund in the message. Don't submit yet

## RM

Thoughts: The agent produced a complete refund message including the subject, an Order ID placeholder, purchase date, clear reason ("broke after three days of normal use"), and a refund-amount placeholder, plus offer to provide photos and return instructions. It followed the user's "Don't submit yet" instruction by leaving placeholders for Order ID and amount. All required fields are present, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to ensure the message includes the required identifiers (order ID, product, purchase date) and a clear requested refund amount plus a concise reason. I will not use Memory 3 because I don't have access to the order details page to calculate exact refundable components or confirm shipping rules—so I'll leave those as placeholders for you to fill.
