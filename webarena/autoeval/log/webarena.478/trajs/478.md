## Intent

Set up a new, empty repository with the name webagent?

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the project name was filled and creation actions performed. The final page displays a confirmation banner "Project 'webagent' was successfully created." and the page shows "The repository for this project is empty", indicating a new empty repository named webagent was created successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. The user explicitly gave the repository name ("webagent") and asked for an empty repository, so I should not ask redundant confirmations about the name or whether it should be empty.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — the user explicitly asked for an empty repository named "webagent", so I will proceed without asking for redundant confirmation.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (do not ask redundant confirmations) because the user explicitly gave the repo name and requested an empty repository. I will not use Memory 2 (confirm initialization and visibility) because that would request redundant confirmation; the form already has defaults and the user didn't ask to change visibility. I will use Memory 3 (ensure initialization options reflect an empty repo) to make sure the README initialization is disabled so the repository is truly empty.
