## Intent

Change the page title of "404 Not Found" page on my site to "Bruh bro you clicked the wrong page".

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the title field was filled and saved. The final page list displays the record with URL Key "no-route" (the 404 page) and its Title now reads "Bruh bro you clicked the wrong page", indicating the change was applied and saved.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Edit item from the listing to change its status" — This is relevant. I will use the approach of opening the Pages listing and then editing the specific CMS page for the 404 page so I can change its title in the page edit screen.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Edit item from the listing to change its status) — Use: Yes. It's relevant because I should open the page's edit screen from the listing so I can change the page title and access all controls.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Edit item from the listing to change its status): Not needed — it suggests opening the item's edit page for status changes, but the row is already in inline edit mode with a visible Title textbox and Save/Cancel controls, so inline edit is fine.
