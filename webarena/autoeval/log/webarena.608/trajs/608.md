## Intent

Find a subreddit focused on topics related to city lives in DMV area, and post my question, "safe and budge apartment to live" there

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only performed a search for "DMV subreddit" and clicked a result; the final page shows search results on Postmill rather than navigating to an actual DMV-focused subreddit page or subreddit on Reddit. There is no evidence the agent located a specific DMV city-living subreddit nor posted the user's question ("safe and budge apartment to live"). Because the required subreddit was not reached and the post was not made, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"
