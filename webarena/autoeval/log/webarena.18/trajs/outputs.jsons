{"id": 18, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for a comparison of walking vs driving time. The page snapshot and directions panel only show the Car (OSRM) route with Distance 8.9 km and Time 0:15. Although the action history toggled the mode between Foot and Car several times, the final state shows only the driving result and there's no evidence the walking travel time was read or reported. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to provide both times (or state one is unavailable). Because the walking time is not present/recorded, the agent did not complete the requested comparison.", "status": "failure"}}
