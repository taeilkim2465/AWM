## Intent

Compare the time for walking and driving route from AMC Waterfront to Univ of Pittsburgh

## RM

Thoughts: The directions panel shows the walking route (Foot (OSRM)) with Distance: 8.0 km and Time: 1:47, but there is no driving (Car) travel time shown or any explicit statement that driving time is unavailable. The user requested a comparison of walking vs driving times; the agent did not present both times or a comparison, so the information request is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the memories because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use?): Yes — this task explicitly asks for a walking route comparison, so I should use walking-mode routing and get a walking estimate rather than relying on straight-line distance.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use walking-mode routing and compare walking distance/time — YES. I will request the walking route from the same origin/destination so the walking estimate is route-based and pedestrian-aware.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use walking-mode routing — I will use this (relevant) because the page already shows a walking route (Foot OSRM) and I should keep that for the walking time.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use walking-mode routing and present walking directions — I will use this (relevant).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (walking-mode routing): Use — the page already shows a walking route (Foot (OSRM)) with Distance: 8.0km, Time: 1:47. I'll keep that as the walking estimate and use it in the final comparison.
===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories to guide this step:
