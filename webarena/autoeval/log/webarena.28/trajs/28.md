## Intent

Tell me the count of comments that have received more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the Worcester forum.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent loaded the comments for the OP (mineinhusdson) and scrolled to reveal more; the final page snapshot shows the comment score indicators (2, 1, 2, 1, 1) — all positive and no negative net scores. The agent reported 0 comments with more downvotes than upvotes, which matches the visible data, so the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (vote display/net score): I will use this. The site may show only net score or hide up/down counts; if so I'll interpret negative net as more downvotes than upvotes or try to find expanded comment details or the user's comments view/API to get breakdowns.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (vote displays/net score): I will not use this right now, but I will keep it in mind for later when counting comments with more downvotes than upvotes (the site might only show net scores). I note that if the UI hides up/down counts, a negative net implies more downvotes; if not available, I'll look for expanded comment details or a user comments view or API data.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories as follows before taking action:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (vote-display guidance): I will use this. The site may show only net scores rather than separate up/down counts; that affects how I determine whether a comment has more downvotes than upvotes (negative net => more downvotes). If needed I'll expand comment details or check the user's comments view or exposed data later.
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. The site may only show a net score for comments instead of separate up/down counts — if so I'll treat a negative net score as "more downvotes than upvotes" and look for expanded comment details or API/data attributes if separate counts are needed.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because the page shows only net scores next to the upvote/downvote buttons; a negative net score means that comment received more downvotes than upvotes. I will use Memory 2 because the user's comments are paginated (there is a "More" link) and I need to traverse all pages before concluding. I will not use Memory 3 (sort/filter confirmations) because I am already on the user's overview/comments listing and no sort change is needed.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2, and not Memory 3.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (vote displays/net score): I will use this. The page shows only a net score for each comment (e.g., "−2", "1"), so a negative net indicates more downvotes than upvotes per Memory 1.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Handle vote displays that show only net score): I will use this. The UI shows a single number between the vote arrows (a net score). Per the memory, a negative net means more downvotes than upvotes, so I'll look for comments with a negative number.
