## Intent

Open my latest created issue that has dependency in its title to check if it is closed

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for "dependency", opened the issue titled "Outdated dependencies" (#18) and reported its status. The page snapshot clearly shows the issue title and a green "Open" badge, so the agent correctly opened the latest matching issue and correctly reported it as Open.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I opened the most recently created issue matching “dependency”. Title: “Outdated dependencies” (#18
