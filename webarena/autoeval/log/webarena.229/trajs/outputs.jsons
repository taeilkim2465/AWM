{"id": 229, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This is an information-seeking task. The agent searched for \"ugreen\", scrolled the results, and reported a price range of $6.99\u2013$24.99 explicitly for the currently visible search results (page 1, items 1\u201312). The page snapshot shows prices of $6.99, $7.49, $7.99 and $24.99, so the reported min/max match the visible items and the agent clearly noted it was only for visible results and offered to check further. Therefore the agent fulfilled the user's request appropriately.", "status": "success"}}
