## Intent

What is the price range for products from ugreen?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent searched for "ugreen", scrolled the results, and reported a price range of $6.99–$24.99 explicitly for the currently visible search results (page 1, items 1–12). The page snapshot shows prices of $6.99, $7.49, $7.99 and $24.99, so the reported min/max match the visible items and the agent clearly noted it was only for visible results and offered to check further. Therefore the agent fulfilled the user's request appropriately.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "From the currently visible search results (page 1, items 1–12

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use the site's search box) because the page has a search combobox and that's the fastest way to find all products for the brand "ugreen". I will also use Memory 2 (state the scope of any reported price range) when I report results so it's clear whether the range comes from visible results or the full result set. I will not use Memory 3 right now because the user asked for a price range, not a full itemized order breakdown; I can provide itemized details later if requested.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the site's search box" — I will not use this now because the search for "ugreen" has already been performed and we're on the search results page.
===============INFO - Memory check:
