Thoughts: The page snapshot only clearly shows Lisa Lee complaining about the ring breaking; the other visible reviews (MH, Diana Alcaraz) do not match the agent's listed complainants (the agent omitted Diana Alcaraz and included Evelyn Kurver, Amanda, N Randall, Misba009 which are not visible in the final snapshot). For an information-seeking task the agent must provide verifiable names or state information is unavailable; the response includes unverified/mismatched entries and is therefore not reliable/complete.

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they are relevant for finding customer contact info and quickly locating specific strings on a page, which may help when scanning reviews. Memory 3 (inferring preferences from product variants) is not needed for this task because the user asked specifically for customer names who complain about quality in reviews.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check likely fields for contact information): NOT USING — it's about finding phone numbers in customer records, not relevant to extracting reviewer names from product reviews.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check likely fields for contact information): I will not use this memory — it's about where phone numbers might be stored in customer records, but the task is to list customer names from product reviews on this page, not to find contact info.
