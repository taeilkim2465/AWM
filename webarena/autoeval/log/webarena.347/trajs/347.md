## Intent

How many reviews our shop received from the beginning of the shop?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for total reviews. The agent clicked through and reported "351 reviews in total" citing the admin list "351 records found." The page snapshot plainly shows "351 records found," so the agent provided the requested information and offered follow-up options. This satisfies an information-seeking task requirement.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Your shop has 351 reviews in total (the admin list shows "351 records found"
