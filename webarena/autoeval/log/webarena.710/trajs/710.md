## Intent

Create a shipping report from 08/05/2022 to 03/01/2023

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the Shipping Report page, populated the From and To fields (showing 8/5/22 and 3/1/23), and clicked the Show Report button. The final page shows the correct date range entered and no errors, so the report generation action was performed successfully.
Status: "success"
