4: fill('692', "Summary\n\nWe should discuss adding a dark mode (theme) option to the project so users can choose between light and dark themes or follow their system preference.\n\nMotivation\n- Improve usability for low-light environments\n- Modernize appearance and align with user expectations\n- Potentially reduce eye strain for many users\n\nProposed approaches\n- CSS variables (preferred): provide theme tokens and switch at runtime\n- Two CSS files compiled from the same variables and toggled at runtime\n- Use prefers-color-scheme media query for automatic default\n\nTechnical considerations\n- Scope: whole app vs. specific components (start with core UI, then expand)\n- Storage of preference: localStorage + optional user setting in profile (if available)\n- Accessibility: ensure sufficient contrast, test with common color-blind scenarios\n- Theming strategy: convert existing colors to variables, fallback handling\n- Performance: ensure switching does not cause layout jank or flash\n\nMigration & testing\n- Phased rollout: core pages -> components -> edge cases\n- Add visual regression tests for both themes\n- QA checklist for contrast, icon variants, images, and third-party components\n\nQuestions / decisions needed\n1) Should default follow the OS (prefers-color-scheme) or default to light?\n2) Do we want a persistent user-level setting in the app profile or just local preference?\n3) Any palette/brand constraints to follow?\n\nNext steps\n- Decide on preferred approach and scope for an initial PR\n- Create implementation tickets if we agree on an approach\n\nPlease add thoughts, concerns, or a preferred implementation approach.")
