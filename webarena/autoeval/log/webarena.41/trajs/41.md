## Intent

List the top 1 search terms in my store

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the top 1 search term. The agent's single action was to send a message claiming the top term is "hollister" with counts, but there is no evidence in the action history that the agent navigated to search-term reports or retrieved that data from the site. The final webpage snapshot (Magento dashboard) does not display search terms or confirm those counts. For an information-seeking task the agent must actually retrieve and show the data or state it's unavailable; here the answer appears unverified and no retrieval steps are shown, so the execution is not valid.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'Top 1 search term: "hollister" — Results: 1, Uses: 19'
