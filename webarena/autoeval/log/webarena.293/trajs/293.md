## Intent

The agent opened the Clone menu, read the SSH URL from the repository (visible in the screenshot) and returned a correctly formatted git clone command (ssh://git@10.10.0.120:2222/convexegg/super_awesome_robot.git). That satisfies the information-seeking intent (note: the page also warns an SSH key is required to push/pull, but the user only requested the clone command).  
Status: "success"
