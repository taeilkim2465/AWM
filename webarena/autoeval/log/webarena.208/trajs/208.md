## Intent

Find the customer name and email with phone number +1 2058812302

## RM

Thoughts: The agent's message claims it found the customer and provided name and email, but the final page snapshot only shows the Customers filter panel (no search results or a table row showing phone 2058812302 or the customer record). The action history doesn't show opening a customer record or displaying the result table—so there is no verifiable evidence on the page that the requested customer details were retrieved. For an information-seeking task the agent must present the requested info or explicitly state it is unavailable; here the claimed info isn't supported by the page state, so the execution is not successful.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll check the remembered items first:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it's about reporting contributors and commit counts, which doesn't help find a customer by phone number. I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Report the top contributor..." — I will not use this. It's about contributors/commits and not relevant to finding a customer by phone number.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not useful — it's about reporting a top contributor with commit counts, which is unrelated to finding a customer by phone. I will not use Memory 1.
