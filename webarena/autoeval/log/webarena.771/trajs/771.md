## Intent

Approve the positive reviews to display in our store.

## RM

Thoughts: The actions show multiple "Update Status" -> "Approved" operations and the page shows the success message "A total of 2 record(s) have been updated." However the visible reviews on the "Pending Reviews" page are negative (e.g., "Bad!" and complaints) and the grid shows 3 records found with only 2 updated — the agent did not specifically target/approve the positive reviews the user wanted. Therefore the agent did perform status updates but failed to accomplish the user's intent of approving positive reviews for display.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will navigate to the Marketing area to find the reviews management interface and approve positive reviews.
===============INFO - I will use the admin navigation to find and approve pending reviews. The Marketing menu is open and I can see "All Reviews" and "Pending Reviews" under User Content.
===============INFO - I'll use the admin Pending Reviews grid to approve the positive reviews. Review IDs that look positive are 352 ("Good but not perfect") and 347 ("Quite good").
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 to confirm there are suitable positive reviews selected before changing status — I can see two reviews are already selected: ID 352 ("Good but not perfect") and ID 347 ("Quite good"), which are positive. I will not use Memory 1 (posting a comment) because the user asked to approve reviews for display, not to add comments. I will not use Memory 3 (search by product identifier) because the needed reviews are already visible and selected.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Post a concise review or comment via the MR's comment/review field" — I will NOT use this. We only need to change review visibility/status (approve reviews) rather than post a comment.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (post a concise review): Not relevant — we are approving existing reviews, not posting a comment.
===============INFO - I will consider the memory items first:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Post a concise review or comment via the MR's comment/review field" — I will not use this. It's about posting comments to an MR timeline, not needed for changing review status in the admin grid.
