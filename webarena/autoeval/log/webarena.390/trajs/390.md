## Intent

Post "lgtm" for the merge request related to semantic HTML post in a11yproject/a11yproject.com project

## RM

Thoughts: The activity feed shows a new comment "lgtm" by the user (Byte Blaze) "just now", and the comment box is back to its placeholder state — this matches fill('969','lgtm') followed by clicking the comment button. Therefore the requested "lgtm" was posted to the merge request successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 to verify page context before taking navigation actions (confirm I'm on the correct project). I will also use Memory 2 because once on the project's merge requests I will need to open the specific merge request and post the comment. I will not use Memory 3 because it's about composing requests and isn't relevant to posting the simple "lgtm" comment.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to confirm I'm navigating to the project's Merge Requests view before attempting to comment, and Memory 2 because once on an individual merge request page I'll need to use the comment input to post "lgtm". Memory 3 isn't relevant for this task.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. I can see the page heading "Add draft of What is Semantic HTML post" and breadcrumbs showing this is merge request !1531, so the page context is correct.
