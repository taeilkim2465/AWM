## Intent

Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got no stars?

## RM

Thoughts: The visible project list in the snapshot shows star counts (21, 21, 6, 6, 2, 2) — none of the visible repositories have zero stars. The page is sorted by "Most stars", so any repositories with 0 stars would be at the bottom of the list; the action history shows no scrolling to the end or any action that would reveal all zero-star projects. There is also no agent response provided that lists repository names or explicitly states there are none. Because the agent did not navigate or show the full list of projects (or state the absence of zero-star repos), it did not provide the requested information.  
Status: "failure"
