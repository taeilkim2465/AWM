===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Locate the target merge request from the project's Merge Requests list): I will use this — it tells me to open the project's Merge Requests listing and scan for the MR by title/description so I can find the specific merge request about the color utility.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it tells me to open the project's Merge Requests list and click the specific MR. I'm on the Merge Requests page and will use the listed MR entry for "Add color utility classes" to open the MR.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Locate the target merge request from the project's Merge Requests list" — I will not use this memory because we're already on the specific merge request page (heading and breadcrumbs show we're on "!1071 Add color utility classes").
