## Intent

Edit my post on Nvidia RTX 4090 by adding a line to the body that says "EDIT: This news aged well"

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the post body was filled with "Crazy device for ML!\n\nEDIT: This news aged well" and the save action was clicked. The page snapshot displays the added line ("EDIT: This news aged well") in the post and a green confirmation "The submission was edited." indicating the edit succeeded.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm creation with clear details and offer next steps" — I won't use this right now because that's for after saving the edit; I'll use it after the post is updated to confirm the change and offer follow-ups.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm creation..." — I will not use this memory for the current step because it's about reporting details after creating a post; right now the user asked to edit an existing post, so it's not directly relevant.
