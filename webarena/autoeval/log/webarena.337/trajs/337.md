Tell me when I last ordered my bread olive?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task (when was "bread olive" last ordered). The agent only inspected a single order page (Order #000000170 dated May 17, 2023) and correctly reported that "bread olive" is not in that order, then prompted the user to choose next steps. It did not search the entire order history or explicitly state that the product is not found anywhere, so the user's request was not fulfilled. Therefore the execution is unsuccessful.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I checked the current order page: Order #000000170 (Canceled
