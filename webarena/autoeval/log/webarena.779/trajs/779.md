## Intent

Reduce the price of yellow shirts from Gwyn Endurance in all size below L by 15%

## RM

Thoughts: The task was to reduce prices of Gwyn Endurance yellow shirts in all sizes below L (XS, S, M) by 15%. The action history shows multiple price edits and the final product page is "Gwyn Endurance Tee-XS-Yellow" with Price $12.53, but there is no action that clicks "Save" and no evidence that S and M variants were opened/updated. Because not all target sizes are confirmed changed and the changes were not saved, the modification is not complete.
Status: "failure"
