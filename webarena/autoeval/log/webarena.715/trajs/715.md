## Intent

Thumbs down the top 2 post ever in history.

## RM

Thoughts: This is a content-modification task (downvoting). The action history shows repeated click actions on post controls, and the final page snapshot displays vote counts of "-1" next to the listed posts (including the top entries), which indicates those posts were downvoted. Therefore the agent did apply downvotes to the top items as requested.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory checks:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter/scan low-stock): Not relevant for this task (it's about inventory stock), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - We need to downvote the top 2 posts of all time. First I should decide whether to use each memory item:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (verify account access) because I need to confirm we are logged in and able to vote before attempting to downvote posts. Memory 1 and Memory 2 are not relevant to this task (they concern inventory and map searches), so I will not use them.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter/low-stock): Not relevant to this task (it's about inventory stock), so I will not use it.
