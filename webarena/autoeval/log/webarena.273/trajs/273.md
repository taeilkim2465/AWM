## Intent

Show me products under $199 in "furtiture with accent" category

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows "Now Shopping by Category: Accent Furniture" so the agent reached the correct category, but the product count remains 806 and the visible Price filter shows only broad ranges (e.g. $0.00 - $999.99). There is no evidence the agent applied a filter for products under $199 (no narrower price range or reduced results). Therefore the user's request (show products under $199 in Accent/Furniture with accent) was not fulfilled.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items to guide navigation and validation:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify product metadata): I will use this — after narrowing results I'll open/inspect product metadata to confirm items are in the correct category and under $199.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify category and price on product-level metadata): I will use this — after we land in the Accent Furniture category, I will inspect individual product metadata (price and category tags) to ensure each product is truly Accent Furniture and priced under $199.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it — I should confirm each candidate's category and price from product metadata / detail pages before finalizing the list.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will verify product-level metadata (price and category) before including items in the final list, so this memory is relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify category and price on product-level metadata): I will use this. We should confirm each product is actually in Accent/Accent Furniture and that the displayed price is under $199 before listing any item details; if a product’s metadata is ambiguous I'll skip it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify category and price on product-level metadata): I will use this — after filtering I'll verify individual product metadata/prices before presenting results.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. I should confirm each candidate product’s category and price from product metadata (not just listing titles) before presenting items under $199.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify category and price on product-level metadata): I will use this — after narrowing to the correct category I will check each product's metadata (title/category tags and displayed price) to confirm it belongs to the requested category and is under $199.
===============INFO - Memory 1: YES — I will use it. I need to verify each product's category and price on the product detail or metadata before listing it to the user, so I'll inspect items after narrowing to the Accent Furniture category.
