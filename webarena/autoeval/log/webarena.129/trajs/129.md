## Intent

What's the total number of items sold in the most recent 4 orders?

## RM

Thoughts: The dashboard screenshot only clearly shows two recent orders (Sarah Miller: 5 items, Grace Nguyen: 4 items). The agent's reply claims four orders (5 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 16) but the additional orders with 3 and 4 items are not visible or verifiable in the provided page snapshot, so the agent's answer is unsupported by the evidence on the page. The agent should have either extracted all four item counts from the page or stated the data wasn't available. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'The total number of items sold in the most recent 4 orders is 16 (5 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 16
