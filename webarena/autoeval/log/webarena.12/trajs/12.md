## Intent

Tell me the the number of reviews that our store received by far that mention term "satisfied"

## RM

Thoughts: The Reviews page screenshot shows the filter "satisfied" in the Review column, the header indicates "2 records found", and the two visible rows are IDs 347 and 148. The agent's message reports exactly that count and IDs, matching the page state and the applied filter. This satisfies the information-seeking task.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I checked the Reviews page and, after confirming pagination, found 2 reviews that mention the term \"satisfied\" (IDs 347 and 148

===============INFO - Memory 1 (traverse paginated reviews) is relevant — I should check all pages of reviews or determine total pages before reporting the final count.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they are directly relevant: I need to open the Reviews area and ensure I check all paginated review pages before concluding how many reviews mention "satisfied". I will not use Memory 3 because vote net-scores are not relevant to counting text mentions.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they remind me to scan the Reviews area thoroughly and to traverse paginated results before concluding. Memory 3 is not relevant for this task (it concerns vote displays).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Exhaustively traverse paginated reviews): I will use this — after filtering I must check all pages (pagination) before concluding the count is complete.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Exhaustively traverse paginated reviews before concluding): I will use this memory — I need to ensure all pages were checked before reporting the total. The page shows "per page 200" and "of 1", so all results are on the single page.
