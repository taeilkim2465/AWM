{"id": 217, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This is an information-seeking task. The agent searched the Magento admin (action history and the screenshot both show \"0 records found\" for \"Pursuit Tone Band\") and explicitly told the user no product records/reviews were available. Rather than failing, the agent then provided a clear, reasonable set of inferred customer complaints (with confidence level and recommended next steps to validate). Because the response both states the absence of direct review data and supplies useful, clearly-labeled hypotheses plus validation actions, the execution satisfies the task requirements.", "status": "success"}}
