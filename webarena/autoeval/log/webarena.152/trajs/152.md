## Intent

What is the minimum travel time by car from Schenley park to Upitt?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the minimum travel time by car between Schenley Park and University of Pittsburgh. The agent filled origin and destination and selected "Car (OSRM)" but the final snapshot shows only the map and input box (with the "Go" button) — no route, no travel time or summary is displayed. Multiple clicks occurred but no computed travel time is visible, so the requested information was not provided.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use mapping/directions tools for routing/time queries): I will use this memory — it directly recommends using the site's directions interface to get driving time estimates.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use mapping/directions tools for routing/time queries): I will use this — the page already shows a directions interface which is the right tool to get estimated driving time.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use mapping/directions tools) is relevant and I will use it — the page already has the origin and destination populated in the directions interface so I should run the directions tool to get the car travel time.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use mapping/directions tools for routing/time queries — I will use this (yes). The OpenStreetMap directions interface is the right tool to get an estimated driving time.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use mapping/directions tools): YES — this page is a directions interface (OpenStreetMap). I'll use it to get the driving time estimate.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use mapping/directions tools for routing/time queries): I will use this — it's directly relevant to get a driving time estimate.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (yes) because the OpenStreetMap directions interface is the appropriate mapping/directions tool to get the driving time. I will not use Memory 2 (no) because the user only asked for car travel time (no multimodal comparison needed). I will not use Memory 3 (no) because the locations are already specific (Schenley Park → University of Pittsburgh).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use mapping/directions tools for routing/time queries): I will use this memory — the page is already a directions interface (OpenStreetMap with OSRM) and it should give driving time estimates, so I should use the directions tool output as the source.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use mapping/directions tools for routing/time queries — I will use this. The page is already the OpenStreetMap directions interface with origin, destination, and "Car (OSRM)" selected; the directions tool is the right source for the driving time.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use mapping/directions tools for routing/time queries): I will use this — the page is a directions interface (OpenStreetMap) so it is the right source for the driving time.
