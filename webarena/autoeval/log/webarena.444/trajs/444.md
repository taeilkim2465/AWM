## Intent

Update the project site's title to "Title Wanted"

## RM

Thoughts: Actions show the title field was cleared and filled with "Title Wanted" and save clicked. The page displays a success banner "Project 'Title Wanted' was successfully updated." and the Project name field contains "Title Wanted", confirming the update completed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Done — the project title has been updated to \"Title Wanted\". I see the success message on the Settings page. Would you like me to change anything else or verify the new title in another place (e.g., project homepage

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It says project titles are editable on the project's Settings page — that's exactly where we are.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it's relevant (it says project titles are edited via Settings). However, the page already shows a success message and the Project name field contains "Title Wanted", so the change appears complete.
