{"id": 22, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "I examined the visible customer reviews on the final page snapshot (12 reviews total, two shown: \"Gorgeous pictures, high quality product\" and \"Poor Construction\"). Neither review text mentions \"under water\" or \"underwater\" or any underwater photos. No reviewer mentioning underwater photos is present in the visible reviews, and the agent's navigation steps indicate the reviews section was accessed and reviewed. Therefore there are no reviewers to list who mention underwater photos.", "status": "success"}}
