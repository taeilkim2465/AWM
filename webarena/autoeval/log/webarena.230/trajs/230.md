## Intent

What is the price range for products from Perricone MD?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the Perricone MD price range. The agent returned a specific range ($35.00–$149.00) drawn from the visible search results (items 1–12 of 175), explicitly noted the limitation that this covers only the current page, and offered clear next steps to obtain a site-wide range or restrict to the Beauty & Personal Care category. This satisfies the information-seeking requirement (provides the available information and states how to get broader results), so the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Based on the current search results page (items 1–12 of 175

===============INFO - I'll use the site's internal search to find Perricone MD products (Memory 2) because that's the fastest way to surface brand listings and prices. I'll also follow the instruction to state the scope of any reported price range (Memory 1 and Memory 3) when I report back, so I'll make it clear whether the range comes from visible results or the entire site.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Always state the scope of any reported price range) — I'll use this. I will explicitly state what subset the price range covers.
