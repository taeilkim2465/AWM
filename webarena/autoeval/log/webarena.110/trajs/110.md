## Intent

Presents the monthly count of successful orders from Jan to Nov 2022 in MM:COUNT format

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for monthly counts Jan–Nov 2022. The agent's actions set the date range to 01/01/2022–01/31/2022 (only January) and the final page shows "We can't find records for this period" with no data. No monthly counts for Jan–Nov were presented and the date range was incorrect/insufficient, so the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide how I get monthly order counts.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I'll try to get monthly totals by grouping or using month-specific ranges rather than tallying individual orders.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use month-specific ranges or grouping to get MM:COUNT. I will use this memory as guidance — I want the data grouped by month (or exported so I can group by month accurately).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (month-specific ranges or grouping): I will use this memory as guidance — ideally we should get month-grouped data or export raw data and group by month ourselves to avoid errors from trying to infer months from a single full-year filter.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Obtain monthly counts by using month-specific ranges or grouping): I will use this memory. It reminds me to prefer getting month-level aggregation rather than opening individual orders. Exporting the filtered data will let me group/count by month reliably outside the UI.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use month-specific ranges or grouping — I will use this. It’s the recommended accurate approach for per-month counts.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I'll apply month-specific date ranges rather than relying on the full-year filter so counts won't overlap or be missed.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use month-specific ranges or grouping — I will use this. If a report page offers grouping by month I'll prefer that; otherwise I'll use month-specific filters.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (month-specific ranges / grouping): I will use this — but instead of manually iterating month-by-month in the Orders grid (which is slow), I want to open the built-in "Order Count" report that should return monthly counts or allow grouping by month.
