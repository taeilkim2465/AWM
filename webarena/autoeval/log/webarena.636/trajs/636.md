## Intent

Post in the most appropriate subreddit and ask for recommendations for DIY toolkit products within a budget of $100

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the title and body and attempted to submit, but the final page clearly displays the error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again," so the post was not created. Although the agent informed the user and offered next-step options, the navigation task of posting to the appropriate subreddit was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I attempted to post to the DIY community, but the site returned: \"You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.\" Options for how to proceed:\n\n1

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm budget and recipient preferences): I will use this. The user already gave a budget ($100) but didn't specify recipient/preferences. I'll include the budget in the post and invite a quick follow-up question in the post for any recipient/use constraints so responders can refine suggestions.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items to shape the post:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to confirm the budget and recipient prefs are included in the post. The post body already states the $100 budget and project types, so I'll rely on that.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm budget and recipient preferences" — I will not use this memory because the user already specified a clear budget ($100) and included must-haves in the post body.

3: fill('142', 'Budget: $100. I\'m putting together a compact DIY toolkit for general home repairs and small projects (basic carpentry, plumbing fixes, light electrical). Looking for durable kits or individual products that fit within $100. Key must-haves: hammer, screwdrivers (flat + Phillips), pliers, adjustable wrench, tape measure, utility knife, level. Optional but nice: socket set, cordless drill (if it can fit the budget), wire strippers.\n\nPlease recommend specific brands/models or ready-made kits, and links or where to buy if possible. Ask me any quick follow-ups if you need more details about project types or usage frequency. Thanks!')

7: send_msg_to_user("I attempted to post to the DIY community, but the site returned: \"You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.\" Options for how to proceed:\n\n1) Wait and retry posting here later — tell me how long to wait or I can retry once if you want now.\n2) Post to a different, also-appropriate community (e.g., Home Improvement or Tools) — I can choose one and try posting there instead.\n3) I can provide the final post text here so you can post it manually on Reddit (I can tailor it to a specific subreddit like r/DIY, r/HomeImprovement, or r/Tools first).\n4) I can revise or shorten the post if you want to increase chances of it passing any filters.\n\nTell me which option you prefer, or give another instruction. (For reference, the draft title and body are already filled for the DIY forum.)")
