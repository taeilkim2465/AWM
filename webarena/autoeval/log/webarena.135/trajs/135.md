## Intent

How many commits did Eric and Kilian make to a11yproject on 1/3/2023?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent responded that Eric made 1 commit on 03 Jan 2023 and Kilian made 0, citing a specific commit SHA and timestamp. However, the final page snapshot only shows March 2023 commits (no January 3 entries) and the action history contains only two generic clicks with no evidence the agent navigated to Jan 3, 2023 or displayed the claimed commit. Because the agent provided a definitive answer without visible supporting evidence on the page and did not demonstrate retrieval of the January 3 commits, the execution is not verifiably correct.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm date format): I will use this — I need to verify how dates are shown on the project's commit list (to avoid DD/MM vs MM/DD mistakes) before counting commits for 1/3/2023.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm the date format before matching commits): I will use this. The page shows dates like "03 Jan, 2023" and "14 Mar, 2023", so the repository uses day-month-year with the month name. I'll interpret "1/3/2023" as 03 Jan 2023 (day=3, month=Jan) to match the page format.
