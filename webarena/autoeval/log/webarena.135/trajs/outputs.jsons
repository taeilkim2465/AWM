{"id": 135, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This is an information-seeking task. The agent responded that Eric made 1 commit on 03 Jan 2023 and Kilian made 0, citing a specific commit SHA and timestamp. However, the final page snapshot only shows March 2023 commits (no January 3 entries) and the action history contains only two generic clicks with no evidence the agent navigated to Jan 3, 2023 or displayed the claimed commit. Because the agent provided a definitive answer without visible supporting evidence on the page and did not demonstrate retrieval of the January 3 commits, the execution is not verifiably correct.", "status": "failure"}}
