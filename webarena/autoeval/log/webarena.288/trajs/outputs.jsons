The agent only clicked around and then asked a clarification (whether to scan in UI or export + compute, and whether to include all time/guest orders). No filter for Status = \"Canceled\" was applied, no export or counting was performed, and no answer was returned. The final page snapshot still shows the unfiltered orders grid (308 records) and no cancellation-count result. Because the agent did not produce the requested information or explicitly state it was unavailable, the task is incomplete.", "status": "failure"}}
