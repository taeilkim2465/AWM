## Intent

Which number to call for the customer service?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the customer service phone number. The agent inspected the Contact Us page (header, contact form, footer) as shown in the final page snapshot and could not find any phone number. The agent explicitly informed the user that no phone number was found on the page and offered clear next steps (search site, send a contact form message, or check account/help pages). For an information-seeking task, explicitly stating the information is not available and proposing follow-ups counts as success.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'I could not find a customer service phone number on this Contact Us page. I inspected the header, the Contact Us form (there is only a "Phone Number" input where you can enter your number

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 (Check likely fields for contact information) because phone numbers are often on the Contact Us page in billing/contact/account sections, so I should open that page and inspect its sections. I will not use Memory 1 or Memory 2 right now: Memory 1 (detailed reporting steps) and Memory 2 (offering numbered next actions) might be useful after I locate the phone number, but they aren't needed before opening the Contact Us page.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 (check likely fields for contact information) because the user asked for a customer service phone number and contact details are commonly on the "Contact Us" page. I'll also use Memory 1 (state what I checked, what's missing, and next steps) to report back what I look at after opening the contact page. I will not use Memory 2 right now since we don't need to present multiple next-action options yet — first I should open the Contact Us page and look for the phone number.

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to report what I checked and next steps.
===============INFO - I will check the memories first:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I'll report which parts of the page I inspected (Contact Us form, header, footer, account links) and note missing phone number.
