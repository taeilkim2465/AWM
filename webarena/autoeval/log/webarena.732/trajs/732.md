## Intent

Edit my post on The Night Agent by adding a line to the body that says "Done watching, pretty cool!"

## RM

Thoughts: The actions show the agent opened the post edit, filled the body with "Done watching, pretty cool!" and saved. The final page image displays that exact line under the post title and a green toast "The submission was edited." confirming the change. This matches the user's intent to add that line to the post body.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to insert the new sentence into the post's body with proper line breaks when editing. Memories 2 and 3 (confirming creation and checking for errors) are useful after saving but are not needed for this immediate step, so I will NOT use them right now.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it reminds me to place the new sentence into the body field with proper formatting (here I'll append the new line — the body is currently empty so I'll just insert the sentence).
