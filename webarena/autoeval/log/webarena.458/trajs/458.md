## Intent

Reduce the price of this product by $5

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to reduce the product price by $5 (from $27.00 to $22.00). The action history shows the agent filled price fields with "27.00" twice and clicked twice, and the final page screenshot still displays the Price as $27.00. The agent did not change the price to $22.00 nor show that it was saved, so the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (site-level filters) — it's about filtering product lists, not needed for editing this product.
===============INFO - I will use the product edit form shown on the page to reduce the price by $5. The current price displayed is $32.00 in the Price input (element 985), so the new price should be $27.00.
