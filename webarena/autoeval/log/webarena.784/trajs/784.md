## Intent

Tell me the email address of the contributor who has the most commits to branch main

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the email of the top contributor to branch "main". The agent attempted to switch to "main" multiple times and then reported that no branch named "main" exists in this repo and therefore the requested info for "main" is not available. The agent also gave the top contributor/email for the currently shown branch (development) and offered next steps. Because the agent explicitly stated that "main" does not exist (i.e. the requested information is unavailable) and provided a correct alternative, the task is successful.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I checked the repository contributors view. There is no branch named “main” in this repo (the branch list shows branches like development and master

===============INFO - Memory 1 (use contributors/insights or API) — I will use this. It directly recommends opening the repository's contributors/insights page or API to get per-contributor commit counts, which is exactly what's needed to find the top contributor.
===============INFO - Memory 1 and Memory 3 are directly relevant: they recommend using the repository's Contributors/Insights view to get per-contributor commit counts. I will use those memories. Memory 2 is not relevant (it concerns repository access/member listings), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the repository's contributors/insights view or API): Yes — this is the most direct way to get per-contributor commit counts for a branch, so I'll use it.
===============INFO - I'll use the repository's Contributors view to get per-contributor commit counts (Memory 1 and Memory 3 are directly relevant). Memory 2 (checking members/access) is not relevant because the user asked for the contributor with the most commits, not who has access.
===============INFO - I'll use the repository's Contributors/Insights view (Memory 1 and Memory 3 are relevant) because it directly lists per-contributor commit counts. Memory 2 is not relevant because it concerns repository access, not commit counts, so I won't use it.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories about checking the repository's contributors/insights view or API because they directly apply to finding the top committer for a specific branch (Memory 1 and Memory 3). I will not use the memory about member listings (Memory 2) because that is about access control, not commit counts.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they recommend using the repository's contributors/insights view (or API) to get per-contributor commit counts — that's exactly what I'm looking at and will use to find the top contributor for the requested branch. I will not use Memory 2 because it talks about repository access/members, which is not relevant to finding commit counts.
===============INFO - Memory 1 is useful — it says to use the repository's contributors/insights view to get per-contributor commit counts (I will use that).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they directly recommend using the repository's Contributors/Insights view (or API) to get per-contributor commit counts — that's exactly the page I'm on and the right approach to find the top contributor for a specific branch. I will NOT use Memory 2 because it's about repository access, which is not relevant to this question.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the repository's contributors/insights view or API to get per-contributor commit counts."

If you want, I can switch the view to master (which exists) and report the top contributor/email for that branch, or else you can confirm another branch to check (e.g. development). Which would you like me to do?")
