The agent attempted to switch to \"main\" multiple times and then reported that no branch named \"main\" exists in this repo and therefore the requested info for \"main\" is not available. The agent also gave the top contributor/email for the currently shown branch (development) and offered next steps. Because the agent explicitly stated that \"main\" does not exist (i.e. the requested information is unavailable) and provided a correct alternative, the task is successful.", "status": "success"}}
