## Intent

Post a review of my recent reading "To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee" in the r/books with my comment "good book!".

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the submission form, filled in the Title ("To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee — Review"), Body ("good book!"), and selected r/books, then attempted to submit but the site displayed the error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The post was not created; the agent informed the user of the rate-limit and offered next-step options. Because the content modification (posting) did not complete, the task failed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I tried to create the post, but the site shows: \"You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.\" The form is filled (Title: \"To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee — Review\", Body: \"good book!\", Forum: r/books
