## Intent

DisLike all submissions created by PatientBuilder499 in subreddit videos

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows searches and clicks but no clear evidence the agent navigated to PatientBuilder499's user submissions or clicked any downvote controls. The final subreddit page snapshot shows posts by other users (no posts by PatientBuilder499) and no visible downvote confirmations for that user’s submissions. Because there's no confirmation that all of PatientBuilder499's submissions in /videos were found and downvoted, the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"
