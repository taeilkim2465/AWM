{"id": 160, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent searched, opened a product page, and reported concrete product details (capacity 40, dimensions 4.33 x 2.95 x 0.98 in, price $11.99) plus a clear recommendation that it will easily hold the user's 6 cards and noting it's larger than a 6-slot wallet. It also offered reasonable next steps (add to cart, search for a compact 6-slot, or show alternatives). The final page snapshot matches the reported product and price. Because the user asked for help finding a storage option and the agent provided the relevant information and options, the task is successful.", "status": "success"}}
