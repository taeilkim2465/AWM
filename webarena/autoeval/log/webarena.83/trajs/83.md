## Intent

What is the duration required to first walk from Carnegie Mellon University to apple store shadyside, and then drive to starbucks on craig street?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for two travel durations (walk CMU → Apple Store, then drive Apple Store → Starbucks). The action history shows repeated attempts but the final page (Car selected, Apple Store → Starbucks) displays "Distance: 0m. Time: 0:00." No walking duration from CMU to the Apple Store is shown, and the drive leg has no valid duration either. The agent therefore did not provide the requested travel times (and the route result appears not computed), so the task failed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the memories about routing profiles to ensure walking time is computed with a pedestrian profile.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use pedestrian routing profile for walking-duration estimates — I will use this (yes) because the user asked for walking time and the walking profile gives realistic walking durations.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they remind me to use a pedestrian routing profile for walking durations — the current page already shows a walking route (Distance: 1.4 km, Time: 0:19) which I will treat as the first-leg walk time. I will not use Memory 2 because it focuses on choosing the closest store and reporting walkability metrics; the user only asked for durations for two specified legs, not for walkability analysis or selecting among multiple stores.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items that recommend using a walking/pedestrian routing profile for walking-duration estimates:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It reminds me to use a pedestrian/walking routing profile for walking estimates — relevant because the user asked for the walk time from Carnegie Mellon to the Apple Store (and the current directions already used Foot (OSRM)).
===============INFO - I will use all three memory items (Memory 1, Memory 2, Memory 3) because they all instruct to use a pedestrian/foot routing profile for walking-time estimates — which is required for the first leg (Carnegie Mellon University -> Apple Store). Using the Foot (OSRM) profile will produce accurate walking duration and distance.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because the user asked for walking time for the first leg, so the walking/pedestrian routing profile is appropriate and should be used to get realistic walking duration. I will also use Memory 2 to ensure walking-mode routing is used for the first leg (we already have the walking directions shown for Carnegie Mellon -> Apple Store, which reports Time: 0:19).
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they instruct to use a pedestrian/walking routing profile for walking-duration estimates; that applies to the first leg (Carnegie Mellon University -> Apple Store). I will not explicitly use Memory 2 (walkability metrics) now because the user asked only for durations, not a detailed walkability analysis.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
