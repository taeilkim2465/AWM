## Intent

Set my gitlab status as Out of Office.

## RM

Thoughts: The action log shows the agent opened some UI, cleared and filled the status text with "Out of Office" and clicked a control, but the final screenshot is the Projects page and contains no visible user status indicator or confirmation that the GitLab status was set. There's no evidence in the final state that the "Out of Office" status was applied, so the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Use on-page status as the source of truth) because after I change your status I should confirm the status indicator on the page shows "Out of Office". Memory 2 and Memory 3 are not relevant for this task (they are about lists and ordering), so I will not use them.
===============INFO - Memory 1 is relevant — I'll treat the status shown on the page as the source of truth (it currently shows "Busy" with the message "Resting due to leg injury.") and proceed to change it. Memory 2 and Memory 3 are not relevant for this action.
===============INFO - Memory 1 is relevant — I'll rely on the status modal fields shown on the page as the source of truth (use it). Memory 2 and Memory 3 are not relevant to this task (do not use them).
