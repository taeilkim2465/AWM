## Intent

Modify the address of order #300 to 987 Cedar Court, Los Angeles, CA, 90012

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent opened order 000000300, edited the address fields (street -> "987 Cedar Court", city -> "Los Angeles", state -> "California", zip -> "90012") and clicked save. The page screenshot displays order #000000300 and a visible success message "You updated the order address." This confirms the new address was saved for the correct order.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 (Enter edit mode before making changes) because it's important to open the order's address edit form before updating fields to avoid accidental edits. I'll also use Memory 1 (Report the updated address plus key order metadata after saving) so that after I save I return a clear confirmation with order number and the new address. Memory 3 (report billing info together with key order metadata) is not necessary for this task unless the user asks to return billing address details as well.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. After I save the change I will report the updated address plus concise order metadata (order number and confirmation that save succeeded) so the user has an auditable confirmation.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (report updated address + key order metadata): I will use this later after I save the change so I can present the updated address and concise order metadata to the user. I will not apply it now.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. I will present the updated address with key order metadata after saving so the change is auditable.
