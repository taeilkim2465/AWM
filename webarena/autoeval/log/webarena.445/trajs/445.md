## Intent

Update the project site's title to "Hello"

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the project name was cleared and filled with "Hello" and saved. The page snapshot displays the success banner "Project 'Hello' was successfully updated." and the Project name field contains "Hello", so the title change took effect.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Done — the project title has been updated to \"Hello\". The page shows: \"Project 'Hello' was successfully updated.\" Would you like me to change anything else (description, visibility, avatar, or project path
