## Intent

Tell me the the number of reviews that our store received by far that mention term "decent"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent reported "0 reviews" and the page indeed shows "0 records found" / "We couldn't find any records." however the screenshot shows the term "decent" was entered in the Nickname filter column, not in the Review text column. The user asked for reviews that mention the term in the review content, so the agent did not search the correct field and could have missed matches. Because the query was applied to the wrong column, the result is unreliable and the task is not successfully completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I searched the Reviews for the term 'decent' and found 0 reviews mentioning it. The results show 'We couldn't find any records.' and the pager shows 1 of 1, so all pages were checked. There are no reviewer names or quotes to provide."

===============INFO - Memory 1 (exhaustively traverse paginated reviews): I will use this — we must ensure we don’t miss matches across pages if pagination remains. If the filter returns multiple pages I'll iterate, but first I'll try filtering to narrow results.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The page has pagination controls; I will use the pagination info to ensure we checked all pages. The pager shows "1 of 1", so there is only one page to check.
