## Intent

Open my latest updated issue that has keyword "dependency" in its title to check if it is closed

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot shows the issue page titled "Outdated dependencies" with a green "Open" badge, matching the agent's message that it opened the latest issue with "dependency" in the title and that its state is Open. The agent fulfilled the user's intent to open that issue and report whether it is closed. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I opened the latest issue with ‘dependency’ in the title: “Outdated dependencies” (issue #18

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter by title keyword and sort by last-updated) is directly relevant — I will use it to find the most recently updated issue with "dependency" in the title.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it tells me to filter by the title keyword and pick the most recently updated matching issue — that's exactly what the user asked for. Memory 2 (verify update in public-facing profile view) is not relevant to opening an issue, so I won't use it. Memory 3 (default assumptions about label/state) is also not needed here because the user specifically asked for the latest updated issue with "dependency" in the title and the issues list is already visible.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It instructs to filter by title keyword and choose the most recently updated match — that matches the user's request to open the latest-updated issue with "dependency" in the title. I used that approach to find an issue titled "Outdated dependencies".
