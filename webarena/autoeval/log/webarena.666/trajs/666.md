## Intent

Submit a request to merge dialog-component branch into dialog branch, assign Carol as the reviewer

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows the merge request exists ("requested to merge dialog-component into dialog"), so the merge request submission part succeeded. However the right sidebar still shows "0 Reviewers" and the reviewer input displays "No matching results" despite filling "Carol" (and an error banner about setting to-do). That indicates Carol was not successfully assigned as a reviewer. Because the user requested both submitting the MR and assigning Carol, and the reviewer assignment failed, the overall task is not complete.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (prefer review-assignment filters) is not relevant right now — we're creating a new merge request, not searching existing MRs, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prefer review-assignment filters over authorship/commit filters" — I will not use this memory item now because we're creating a merge request and selecting branches; review-assignment filters apply when searching for MRs to review, not for creating one.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prefer review-assignment filters..." — I will not use this memory now because we're creating a merge request and assigning a reviewer; it relates to MR list filtering, not this creation flow.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3 but not Memory 1.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prefer review-assignment filters..." — not useful here (we're on a specific merge request page and need to set a reviewer), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer review-assignment filters): Not needed — we're already on the specific merge request page and just need to add a reviewer, so review-assignment filters are irrelevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer review-assignment filters): Not needed for this step — we're already on the merge request page and just need to request a reviewer, so I won't use that memory now.
===============INFO - Memory review:
