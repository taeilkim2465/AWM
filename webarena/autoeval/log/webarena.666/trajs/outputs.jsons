However the right sidebar still shows \"0 Reviewers\" and the reviewer input displays \"No matching results\" despite filling \"Carol\" (and an error banner about setting to-do). That indicates Carol was not successfully assigned as a reviewer. Because the user requested both submitting the MR and assigning Carol, and the reviewer assignment failed, the overall task is not complete.", "status": "failure"}}
