## Intent

Add Tide PODS Spring Meadow Scent HE Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs, 81 Count to my wish list

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a green confirmation banner stating "Tide PODS Spring Meadow Scent HE Turbo Laundry Detergent Pacs, 81 Count has been added to your Wish List." The My Wish List page displays 1 item (and the Tide product image) and the header/nav indicates "My Wish List 1 item," so the item was successfully added.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will search the store for the exact product name and then add it to the wish list from the product page or results.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 because that applies when the user asks to view a list page; here we need to add an item to the wish list, not open the list page.
