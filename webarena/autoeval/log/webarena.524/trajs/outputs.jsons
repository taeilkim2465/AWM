{"id": 524, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent did not perform the requested starring action. Instead it stopped to ask clarification (send_msg_to_user) about whether to star global vs contributed repos and which account to use. The action history and final snapshot show navigation to a project's \"Starrers\" list (users who starred a project), not a sorted list of top-starred projects, and no starring of eight repositories occurred. Therefore the task (content modification: star the top eight repos) was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
