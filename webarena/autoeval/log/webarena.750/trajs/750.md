## Intent

Start a private project agi_index with HTML template and add Vinta Chen as members

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot and action history show the Pages/Plain HTML template is selected but the Project name field still contains the placeholder (no "agi_index" entered), the Visibility is set to Public rather than Private, and there is no evidence any members (Vinta Chen) were added. The required name, privacy setting, and member addition were not completed, so the task was not accomplished. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Ensure the chosen template is applied and the repo is truly blank" — I will use this. After selecting the HTML template I'll verify the template indicator and check initial files to confirm the project content matches expectations.
===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide my actions:
===============INFO - I'll use the past-memory items as guidance:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use all three memory items.
