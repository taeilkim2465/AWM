## Intent

Disable Cora Pant from the site, they are facing some quality issues.

## RM

Thoughts: The product edit page shows "Enable Product" set to No (the product was toggled off), but there is no clear evidence the "Save" action was completed and persisted. The action history does not explicitly show a save confirmation (clicks could be other elements), and the final page still shows the Save button (no confirmation or success message). Because disabling requires saving the change to take effect on the site, the task was not conclusively completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use the admin Catalog > Products list to find the "Cora Pant" product and disable it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (date format) — not relevant for this task (we're changing product status, no date inputs). I will not use it now.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (date format) is not relevant for toggling a product, so I will not use it.
