## Intent

Create an issue in a11yproject repo with title "401 bad gateway". Assign the issue to Roshanjossey. Set due date to be the end of 2030

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent filled the title ("401 bad gateway") and used quick actions to assign and set a due date. The page snapshot's Activity confirms "assigned to @Roshanjossey just now" and "changed due date to December 31, 2030 just now," so the issue was created, assigned, and the due date set. Therefore the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Done — I created the issue \"401 bad gateway\" (a11yproject/a11yproject.com#1534

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not needed — it's about milestones; task is to create a single issue so I won't use it now.
===============INFO - I will use the repository Issues page to create a new issue and set the assignee and due date.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 (Assign users from the issue details page) because after creating the issue it's fastest to set the assignee from the issue detail view. I will not use Memory 1 (milestone formatting) because the user didn't ask to create a milestone; it's irrelevant now. I will not use Memory 3 (filtered list view) because we don't need to locate existing issues by assignee.
===============INFO - I will use GitLab quick actions in the description to set the assignee and due date because the assignee picker can be slow or require searching; quick actions reliably apply on issue creation.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (milestone guidance): Not needed — we're setting an issue assignee and due date, not creating a milestone.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Create clear milestone..." — I will not use this. It relates to creating milestones and adding dates/descriptions; the user asked to create an issue, and the due date was set directly on the issue already.
