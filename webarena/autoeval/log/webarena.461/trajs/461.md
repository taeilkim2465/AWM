## Intent

Increase the price of this product by $11.5

## RM

Thoughts: The agent cleared the price field and filled it with 29.50 (action 3) then clicked (action 4). The final page shows the Price field set to $29.50, which matches an increase of $11.50 from the expected original price (i.e. the price was updated to the intended new amount). Therefore the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"
