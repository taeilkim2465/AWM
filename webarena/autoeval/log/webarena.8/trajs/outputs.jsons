{"id": 8, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for full addresses of all international airports within a 5 km driving distance of Carnegie Mellon University. The agent explicitly stated there are none within a 5 km driving distance and provided the nearest international airport (Pittsburgh International Airport) with its full postal address and an approximate driving distance well over 5 km. For an information-seeking task the agent either must supply the requested info or explicitly state it's not available; the agent did so and gave supporting details. Therefore the execution is successful.", "status": "success"}}
