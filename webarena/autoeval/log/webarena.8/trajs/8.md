## Intent

Tell me the full address of all international airports that are within a driving distance of 5 km to Carnegie Mellon University

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for full addresses of all international airports within a 5 km driving distance of Carnegie Mellon University. The agent explicitly stated there are none within a 5 km driving distance and provided the nearest international airport (Pittsburgh International Airport) with its full postal address and an approximate driving distance well over 5 km. For an information-seeking task the agent either must supply the requested info or explicitly state it's not available; the agent did so and gave supporting details. Therefore the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the memories because they are relevant:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I will compute driving distances with a routing/directions tool rather than relying on straight-line distances.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. The user specifically asked for airports "within a driving distance of 5 km", so I should compute driving distances using a routing/directions service rather than straight-line distances. I'll use this memory as guidance for the methodology.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it — route-based driving distances are required rather than straight-line distances.
