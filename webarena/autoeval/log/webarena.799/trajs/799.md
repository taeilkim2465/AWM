## Intent

create a new group "n-lab" with members patou, egpast, westurner, jontutcher

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot shows the group "n-lab" exists (top-left) but the Members list displays only 1 member (Byte Blaze / "It's you"), so the four requested members (patou, egpast, westurner, jontutcher) were not added or invited successfully. Despite actions filling member fields and clicking invite, the final page evidence shows the invites did not appear — task incomplete.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check current members and pending invites before inviting" — I will use this memory later when adding members to avoid duplicate invites. For now we are starting group creation, so I'll keep this in mind for the member-invite step.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check current members and pending invites before inviting" — I will keep this and use it later when adding members so we don't send duplicate invites. I will not use it right now because first I need to open the New group creation page.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check current members and pending invites before inviting" — I will NOT use this memory right now because we first need to create the group. This check is relevant later when adding members to avoid duplicate invites.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check current members and pending invites before inviting" — I will use this. It’s best to confirm people aren’t already members or already invited before sending invites.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it — we should check current members and pending invites before inviting new people to avoid duplicates.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items before inviting to avoid duplicate invites and ensure the group exists.

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I should check if the users are already members or have pending invites before trying to invite them. I'll search the group's members list.
