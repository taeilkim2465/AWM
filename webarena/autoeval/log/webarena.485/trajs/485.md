## Intent

Vinta wants to check my dotfile configurations. Please invite him to the repo as a guest.

## RM

Thoughts: The modal shows "Vinta Chen" added in the Username/email field and the role set to Guest, but there is no evidence the "Invite" button was pressed (it appears inactive/unclicked in the final snapshot). Since the invitation was not actually submitted, the guest was not invited — the modification step is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they remind me to check for existing members/pending invites and to confirm the invite was sent — both important when inviting someone to a repo. Memory 3 isn't relevant (it's about repo creation details), so I won't use it.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites before inviting) because I need to confirm Vinta isn't already a member or already invited before creating a new invite. I will also use Memory 2 (Verify invite completion and check pending invites) because after sending an invite I should confirm it appears in the pending invites and look for success confirmation. I will not use Memory 3 since it's about repo creation details, which isn't relevant here.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I should check whether Vinta is already a member or already invited before creating an invite to avoid duplicates.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I should confirm Vinta isn't already a member or already invited before creating a new invite. I can see the current members list (Abishek S, Byte Blaze (you), yjlou) and Vinta is not listed, so it's safe to invite.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites) — I will use this. We should confirm Vinta is not already a member or already invited before sending a new invite.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2.
===============INFO - Memory checks:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites before inviting): I will use this memory — it's important to avoid duplicate invites. I see the members table (Abishek S, Byte Blaze, yjlou) and no obvious "Vinta" entry, but I'll still proceed carefully by using the invite dialog to search the user (the invite textbox is focused in the modal).
===============INFO - Memory check:
