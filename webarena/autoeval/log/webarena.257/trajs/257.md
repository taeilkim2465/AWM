What is the hours of operation of Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the store hours for "Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh" (an information-seeking task). The action history shows repeated searches but the final page snapshot is just the Nominatim search interface and a world map with no search results or a place details panel visible. No hours of operation are shown or reported, and there is no evidence the agent retrieved or returned the requested information. Therefore the task did not complete successfully.
Status: "failure"
