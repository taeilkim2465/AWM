## Intent

What is the rating of Ugreen lightning to 3.5mm cable. Please round to the nearest whole number

## RM

Thoughts: The agent reported "65" (65%) as the product rating, but the page snapshot shows individual review rating stars (appearing as five orange stars for visible reviews) and no overall 65% numeric rating. The action history doesn't show the agent extracting a numeric aggregate score from the page (just clicking and then sending the incorrect numeric answer), so the provided answer is unsupported by the page content. Therefore the information-seeking task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I inspected the product rating block and reviews on the product page. The rating shown is 65% (65 % of 100
