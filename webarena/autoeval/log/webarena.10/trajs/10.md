## Intent

Tell me the full address of all US international airports that are within a driving distance of 60 km to Niagara Falls

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the full addresses of all US international airports within a 60 km driving distance to Niagara Falls. The action history shows searches and routing on OpenStreetMap (routes to Buffalo Niagara International Airport and queries for Niagara Falls International Airport), and the final page is a directions map to Buffalo Niagara Intl. However there is no evidence the agent returned or displayed the full addresses for all relevant US international airports (only Buffalo's full address was entered into a form; Niagara Falls Intl's full address was not provided). The agent did not present a complete list of full addresses as the user requested, so the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"
