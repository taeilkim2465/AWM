## Intent

Telll me the grand total of invoice 000000001.

## RM

Thoughts: The invoices table in the page snapshot shows invoice 000000001 on the first row with Grand Total (Purchased) $36.39. The agent searched for the invoice and reported the grand total as $36.39, which matches the page. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'The grand total for invoice 000000001 is $36.39.'

===============INFO - I will try to find invoice 000000001 using the page search box.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Cross-check totals by inspecting pager and last-page remainder): Not needed — the invoice list shows the specific invoice and its totals on the current page, so I don't need to verify page counts for this single-item lookup.
