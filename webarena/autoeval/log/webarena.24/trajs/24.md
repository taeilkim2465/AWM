## Intent

List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about price being unfair

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened the Reviews tab, extracted both reviews (Jay: "Nothing.....everyday use." and Josef Bürger: "Die Haflinger sind wie beschrieben und erwartet sehr gut"), and clearly stated that no reviewer on this page mentions price being unfair. The page snapshot confirms only those two reviews and no mention of price, so the information-seeking task was completed correctly.
Status: "success"

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they instruct me to capture each reviewer's name, an exact short quote, and the source location for verification when listing reviewers who mention an issue (price being unfair). I will not use Memory 3 because it's unrelated to product reviews or pricing.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it instructs to include exact quoted text and source location when listing reviewers, which I'll follow.
