## Intent

Change my reddit bio to "I am a robot"

## RM

Thoughts: The biography textarea and preview both show "I am a robot", the profile sidebar displays the new bio, and a green success message at the bottom-left reads "The biography was updated." The fill and save actions were performed. These confirm the change was applied.
Status: "success"
