## Intent

Fill the "contact us" form in the site for a refund on the iphone case I bought, stating that it broke after just three days of use. Also, ensure to include the order number #180 and the product SKU. Don't submit yet, I will check.

Thoughts: The agent filled the Contact Us form fields with the user's name and email and populated the "What's on your mind?" message with the refund request text that includes Order #180 and the product SKU (B087QJN9W1). The action history shows the message was updated to include the SKU and the agent explicitly stated it did NOT submit the form. The phone number field is blank (the user didn't request a phone number), and the final page snapshot shows the textarea content (scrolled to the signature), consistent with the filled message. Therefore the agent met the user's instructions to prepare the form with the refund request, include order number and SKU, and not submit it.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'I filled the "Contact Us" form with your refund request and DID NOT submit it. Here is the message currently in the "What’s on your mind?" field for you to review:\n\nHello,\n\nI am requesting a refund for the iPhone case I purchased (Order #180, SKU: B087QJN9W1

The memory also suggests stating an exact refund amount — the user did not specify an amount, so I will ask the user if they want a specific refund amount, rather than inventing one.
