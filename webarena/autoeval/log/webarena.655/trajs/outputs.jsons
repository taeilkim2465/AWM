{"id": 655, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent filled the Contact Us form fields with the user's name and email and populated the \"What's on your mind?\" message with the refund request text that includes Order #180 and the product SKU (B087QJN9W1). The action history shows the message was updated to include the SKU and the agent explicitly stated it did NOT submit the form. The phone number field is blank (the user didn't request a phone number), and the final page snapshot shows the textarea content (scrolled to the signature), consistent with the filled message. Therefore the agent met the user's instructions to prepare the form with the refund request, include order number and SKU, and not submit it.", "status": "success"}}
