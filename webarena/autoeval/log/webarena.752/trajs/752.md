## Intent

Create a private blank repository called "web_agent" using the right template to speed up development.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened the "Create new project" page and correctly asked the user whether they want a blank repo or a template (and what stack/README preference). However it has not actually created the "web_agent" repository or selected/apply a template yet. The final page shows the project type options but no repo was created, so the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'Do you want a truly blank private repository named \"web_agent\", or do you want me to apply a starter template to speed development? If a template, tell me the stack (e.g., Node.js, Python, Rails, Go, or a generic \"starter\" template

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Know whether a chosen template scaffolds starter files vs a blank repo): I will use this memory — it's important to pick a template that yields a blank repo or to remove scaffolded files if a template adds them (the user asked for a blank repository). I'll verify after creating the project.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Know whether a chosen template scaffolds starter files vs a blank repo — I will use this memory because templates often add files and the user asked for a "blank repository" while also wanting a template to speed development; I need to confirm whether the template will add starter files or we should pick a truly blank template.
