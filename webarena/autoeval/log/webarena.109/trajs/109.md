## Intent

Presents the monthly count of successful orders from Jan to December 2022 in MM:COUNT format

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the correct filters (Purchase Date 1/01/2022 - 12/31/2022 and Status: Complete) and shows "115 records found" in the final page, but it did not present a monthly breakdown (MM:COUNT) for Jan–Dec 2022. The export dialog is open but no evidence the agent produced or returned a CSV with monthly counts, nor did the agent aggregate orders by month on the page. Because the user asked for per-month counts and the agent's output does not provide them or state they are unavailable, the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories as follows before proceeding:
===============INFO - Memory usage:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify filter application & handle pagination/aggregation): I will use this — after I change filters I will confirm they applied and may need to export or aggregate if the UI doesn't summarize by month.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I'll confirm filters applied and watch for pagination/aggregation (memory says to verify results update and aggregate across pages if needed).
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows before taking action:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify filter application and handle pagination or aggregation): I will use this. I need to make sure the Status filter (Complete) is actually applied and that the export includes all matching rows (not just the current page) so I can aggregate monthly counts accurately.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It reminds me to confirm filters applied and use the UI counts rather than opening every order. After applying a monthly date filter I'll read the "records found" to get the monthly count.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
