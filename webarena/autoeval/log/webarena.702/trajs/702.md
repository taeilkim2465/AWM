## Intent

Draft a new marketing price rule for Pride Month that offers 45% off on all products for all customers

## RM

Thoughts: The UI shows the yellow confirmation "You saved the rule." and the action history fills the rule name, description, Main Website, date range (Jun 1–30, 2026), and sets the discount to 45% before saving — all required fields for a sitewide, auto-applied cart price rule were completed. Although the list view doesn’t show the new row in the visible portion of the table, the successful save banner plus the save actions indicate the rule was created and activated as requested.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Done — I created the cart price rule and verified it was saved.\n\nSummary (based on the checklist

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a creation checklist for cart price rules — I will use this. It reminds me to confirm required fields (rule name/description, active status, websites/stores, customer groups, coupon type, discount type/amount, date range, priority, usage limits) before saving.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they contain the checklist and typical settings for creating cart price rules (rule name/description, active status, websites/stores, customer groups, coupon type, discount type and amount, date range, priority, usage limits). These will guide filling the form for a site-wide percent-off rule. I will not use Memory 3 because it relates to computing product price ranges, which isn't needed for drafting the rule.
