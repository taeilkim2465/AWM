## Intent

Post in the most appropriate subreddit and ask for recommendations for noise-cancelling headphones products within a budget of $200

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the title/body and selected r/headphones, but the final page shows a rate-limit error ("You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.") and the post was not submitted. Although the agent prepared ready-to-post content and offered options, it did not complete the required action of posting to the subreddit. Therefore the task (actually making the post) was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I used the memories as follows:\n- Memory 1: YES — kept the $200 budget and use-case in the post.\n- Memory 2: YES — the body is concise and contains the key attributes.\n- Memory 3: YES — I picked the most relevant community (r/headphones

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the memories to shape the post content and choose a subreddit automatically.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm budget and recipient preferences" — I will use this. The user already provided a budget ($200), but it's helpful to include concise preferences in the post so respondents can give tailored suggestions.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — the post already includes a clear budget and use-case, so I'll rely on that to make the post appropriate.
===============INFO - I will reference the three memory items before acting.

## Main Prompt

```md
User Intent: Post in the most appropriate subreddit and ask for recommendations for noise-cancelling headphones products within a budget of $200

Action History:
1: click('63')
2: fill('137', 'Recommendations for noise-cancelling headphones under $200?')
3: fill('142', 'Budget: $200 max.\n\nLooking for noise-cancelling headphones — preferably over-ear and wireless if possible. Use case: daily commute (public transit) and occasional work calls. Priorities: strong ANC, comfort for multi-hour use, and a decent mic for calls. Battery life and brand/reliability are a plus but not required if ANC and comfort are great. Open to wired options if they offer significantly better ANC/value.\n\nPlease recommend specific models available in the US within $200, with a short pros/cons list or notable deals. Happy to answer follow-up questions about fit, music vs. calls balance, or brand preferences. Thanks!')

If you prefer r/audiophile or another sub, tell me.\n\nProblem: The page shows a rate-limit message: \"You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.\" I cannot submit the post from this account right now.\n\nOptions I can take next (pick one):\n1) Wait and submit the current post to r/headphones when the account is allowed to post again. I can try to submit periodically if you want.\n2) Prepare and give you the final post text (title + body + recommended subreddit) so you can manually post it now on Reddit or elsewhere. (I’ve already prepared it below.)\n3) Post to a different community or platform you provide access to instead.\n\nSuggested subreddit: r/headphones (best fit). Alternative: r/audiophile (for higher-end recommendations).\n\nReady-to-post content (title and body exactly as I would post):\nTitle: Recommendations for noise-cancelling headphones under $200?\n\nBody:\nBudget: $200 max.\n\nLooking for noise-cancelling headphones — preferably over-ear and wireless if possible.

If you want me to wait and post automatically, tell me to proceed and whether r/headphones is fine. If you want manual posting text changed, tell me what to edit.")
