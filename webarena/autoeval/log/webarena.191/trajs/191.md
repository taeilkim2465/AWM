## Intent

Tell me the total cost of my latest processing order?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the total cost of their latest processing order. The agent replied with a specific latest order (#000000189) and provided the order total ($754.99). For an information-seeking task the agent's response contains the requested information (it either should provide the info or state it's unavailable), so this satisfies the requirement even though the final snapshot shows the account page rather than order details.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Your latest processing order is order #000000189 (5/02/2023

===============INFO - I will check the Recent Orders table on the My Account page to find the most recent order whose status indicates it's still processing (Pending).
