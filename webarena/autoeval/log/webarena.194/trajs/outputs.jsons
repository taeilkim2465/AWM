{"id": 194, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The dashboard snapshot only shows two last orders ($194.40 and $190.00) and there's no action history showing the agent opened the Orders list or verified five completed orders. The agent's message claims a five-order total and gives a 5-item breakdown (total $807.40) that is not supported by the visible page or by any navigation/verification actions, so the information appears unverified/possibly fabricated. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to show or explicitly state unavailable data \u2014 it did neither.", "status": "failure"}}
