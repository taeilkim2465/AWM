Which US states border New Hampshire?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked which US states border New Hampshire. The agent replied with Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont — these are the three US states that border New Hampshire (New Hampshire's northern neighbor is Quebec, Canada, but the user asked for US states). The response is accurate and complete.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "New Hampshire has 3 U.S. land-bordering states:\n1. Maine\n2. Massachusetts\n3. Vermont"
