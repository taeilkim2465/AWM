{"id": 432, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked the agent to add the lowest per-unit product from the user's open tabs to the cart. The agent only sent a clarifying message asking whether to include bulk/promotional listings and for permission to check other tabs, and noted this tab's per-unit price (~$0.60/can). There is no evidence the agent checked other open tabs, compared per-unit prices, or clicked \"Add to Cart\" on any page (the snapshot shows the product page but the Add to Cart button was not activated). Because the required modification (adding the lowest per-unit product to the shopping cart) was not performed, the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
