## Intent

Draft a refund message via their "contact us" form for the phone screen protector I bought March 2023. It broke after three days of use. The shop requires the order id, the reason and the amount to refund in the message. Don't submit yet

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for a drafted refund message (not to submit). The agent provided a complete template message including the required order ID, reason, and refund amount fields, plus purchase details and next-step questions. It did not submit the form and left placeholders for the user to fill, satisfying the user's requirements. The webpage snapshot shows no submission occurred. 
Status: "success"
