## Intent

Increase the price of all blue running tshirts in extra small and small sizes by 23%

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows only the XS blue variant ("Atomic Endurance Running Tee (V-neck)-XS-Blue") with Price $52.10. The action history shows multiple price fills (34.44 → 42.36 → 52.10) but there is no evidence the agent opened or updated the small (S) blue variant. The user requested increasing prices for both extra-small and small blue running T-shirts by 23%; only the XS variant is visible/updated in the final snapshot, so the task is not fully completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Support aggregates with representative itemized examples): NOT using — this step is an in-page edit of individual variants, not a summary report, so listing example items isn't needed now.
