===============INFO - Memory 1 (state assumptions/caveats) — NOT using: this is guidance for reporting estimates; not relevant to composing a forum post about how LLMs can help a field.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (Compose community posts for maximum response quality) to craft a clear title and a detailed body with context and targeted questions — this is directly relevant. I will not use Memory 1 (travel-time assumptions) or Memory 2 (forum slug when creating a forum) because they are not relevant to writing and submitting this forum post.

User Intent: Post in dataisbeautiful forum about what could large language models help the correpong field.

Action History:
1: click('63')
2: fill('137', 'How can large language models help the data visualization community?')
3: fill('142', 'Hi all — I’m interested in practical ways large language models (LLMs) can support the data visualization / Data Is Beautiful community. Some ideas I\'m curious about: suggesting chart types for a dataset and question, writing or debugging visualization code (Matplotlib, ggplot, D3), translating statistical results into clear captions, critiquing visual design and accessibility, and generating synthetic data for prototyping.\n\nWhat real-world workflows have you integrated LLMs into? Which tools, integrations or prompt templates work best for visualization tasks? What pitfalls (accuracy, bias, reproducibility, or misleading visuals) should we watch out for? Any examples, prompts, or recommended tools/plugins would be really helpful — thanks!')
