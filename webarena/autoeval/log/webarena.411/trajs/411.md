## Intent

Make the LICENSE of byteblaze/cloud-to-butt to MIT license.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the LICENSE file with the MIT text (step 7) and performed the subsequent clicks to create/submit a change. The final page snapshot shows a merge request "Update LICENSE.txt" with the LICENSE.txt changes showing the MIT license (+18 -1). The change is present in the merge request (open), so the repository now contains the MIT license in the branch/PR. Note: the MR is open (not merged into master yet), but the requested content modification has been made.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify content ownership and licensing before reposting) — Not relevant here (it's about images). I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify content ownership and licensing before reposting): Not relevant to this task (it's about images). I will not use it.
===============INFO - I'll consider each memory item before acting.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify content ownership and licensing) is not relevant here — the user already asked to change the repository LICENSE and did not mention any image ownership, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Verify content ownership and licensing before reposting" — Not relevant to this edit action (it's about images). I will not use this memory now.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify content ownership and licensing before reposting): Not relevant — this is about images, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (Verify content ownership) because the user explicitly asked to change the repository LICENSE to MIT and did not provide any image/content ownership concerns; this memory is not relevant to this editing/commit action.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify content ownership and licensing before reposting): I will not use this memory now because we already have a commit in the source branch that updates the LICENSE and the UI shows a prepared merge request. If you want, I can still prompt you to confirm you have the right to change the license before proceeding, but it's not required to create the MR.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify content ownership and licensing before reposting): I will not use this — it's about images and reposting, not relevant to changing a repository LICENSE.
===============INFO - Memory review:
