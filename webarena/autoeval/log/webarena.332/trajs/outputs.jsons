{"id": 332, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user wanted monthly spending for Jan\u2013Mar 2023. The agent expanded the orders list (selected 50 per page) and summed visible orders, explicitly listing each included order and totals for Jan ($572.88), Feb ($947.50), Mar ($83.31) and the grand total $1,603.69 (excluding canceled). It also identified canceled items and showed the totals if those are included (Feb = $1,354.03; Jan\u2013Mar = $2,010.22). The sums are consistent with the listed order amounts and the page snapshot (3/11, 3/10, 2/27 visible; canceled 2/24 and 2/11 noted). The agent therefore provided the requested information and a clear option to include canceled orders.", "status": "success"}}
