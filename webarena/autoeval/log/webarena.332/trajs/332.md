## Intent

How much I spend each month from Jan to the end of March 2023 on shopping at One Stop Market?

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted monthly spending for Jan–Mar 2023. The agent expanded the orders list (selected 50 per page) and summed visible orders, explicitly listing each included order and totals for Jan ($572.88), Feb ($947.50), Mar ($83.31) and the grand total $1,603.69 (excluding canceled). It also identified canceled items and showed the totals if those are included (Feb = $1,354.03; Jan–Mar = $2,010.22). The sums are consistent with the listed order amounts and the page snapshot (3/11, 3/10, 2/27 visible; canceled 2/24 and 2/11 noted). The agent therefore provided the requested information and a clear option to include canceled orders.  
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the saved memories as guidance:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they remind me to look for date-range filters, summaries, or export options instead of opening every order one-by-one — that will be faster and less error-prone. Memory 3 (automate month-range queries) is useful if the site doesn't offer a summary or filters; I won't use it immediately but will keep it in mind as a fallback.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer filters/exports): I will not use this memory directly because the page already shows all orders (37 items) and "Show per page" is set to 50, so all relevant orders for Jan–Mar 2023 are visible. If you want a CSV/export I can look for an export option, but none is obvious here.
