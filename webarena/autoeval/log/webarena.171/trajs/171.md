## Intent

Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got less than 5 stars?

## RM

Thoughts: The Projects page in the final snapshot shows star counts and roles. I can see two repositories with fewer than 5 stars where the user is a contributor/owner: "Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club" (2 stars) and "Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website" (2 stars). The page provides the necessary information, so the agent reached the data needed to answer the question. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Filter contributed repositories and sort by stars descending" — I will NOT use this. It sorts descending (most stars) which is the opposite of what we need.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to restrict results to repositories the user contributed to and to collect star counts. I'll apply this when interpreting the page.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (sort descending) — I will not use this memory because I need the least-starred (ascending) or to filter contributed repos, not the most-starred order.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it partially — it reminds me to restrict results to repositories the user contributed to and to look at star counts. This is relevant.
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories to guide the next step.
