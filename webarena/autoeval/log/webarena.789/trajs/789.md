Thoughts: The action history shows the agent filled the title and body, clicked to submit, and the final page snapshot displays the newly created open issue titled "Support for Webagent in Hugging Face dataset — planned for next quarter?" with the submitted content visible. The agent's confirmation message also states the issue was created (byteblaze/webagent#1). This meets the user's intent to create the issue.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Done — I created the issue titled \"Support for Webagent in Hugging Face dataset — planned for next quarter?\". Next actions I can take for you:\n\n- Add/modify assignees (assign yourself or others

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Offer next-step actions after creating an issue): I will not use it right now, but I will apply it after the issue is created to prompt the user about labels, assignees, etc.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (offer follow-up actions after creating the issue) because after submitting the issue it's helpful to prompt the user about setting labels, assignees, etc. I'll use Memory 2 (create the issue first, then adjust metadata) — so I'll create the issue now and leave metadata changes for afterward. I will not use Memory 3 (order/product identifiers) because it's not relevant to this issue.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Offer next-step actions immediately after creating an issue): I will use this — it's directly relevant because the issue was just created and the user may want follow-up actions (labels, assignees, etc.).
