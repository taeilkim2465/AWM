## Intent

Notify Jane Doe in their most recent pending order with message "sorry we are out of stock, please reorder"

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to notify Jane Doe on their most recent pending order. The agent searched Orders with Keyword: Jane Doe and Status: Pending (actions show the filter applied) and the page shows "0 records found." The agent then informed the user no pending order exists and asked how to proceed, but it did not send the requested message or otherwise complete the notification. Therefore the requested content modification (sending the notification) was not performed.  
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I checked the Orders page: it currently has filters Keyword: Jane Doe and Status: Pending, and it shows 0 records found. There is no pending order for Jane Doe to add a notification to. How would you like to proceed?\n\nOptions:\n- Remove the Status (Pending

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The task requires selecting the most recent pending order, so I will filter to pending orders and sort by date (newest first) before picking a result.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because the user asked to target the "most recent pending order" — so I should filter to pending orders and sort by date/time descending before selecting the most recent one. I will not use Memory 2 because it relates to excluding in-progress/completed orders (the user specifically asked for a pending order).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Filter and sort before choosing "most recent pending") — I will use this. It advises applying a status filter (Pending) and sorting by date descending before picking the result. The table already appears sorted by Purchase Date descending (there's a down arrow on the Purchase Date header), so sorting may already be correct. I'll still narrow results to the customer first so it's easier to inspect the orders for Jane Doe, then apply the Status=Pending filter if needed.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3, but not Memory 2.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it instructs to filter to pending status and sort by date before picking the most recent pending order. I'll apply the Status = "Pending" filter.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Filter and sort before choosing "most recent pending"): I will use this — the interface already has the "Status: Pending" filter and is sorted by Purchase Date descending, so I checked that step was followed.
