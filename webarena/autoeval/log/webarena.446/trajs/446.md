## Intent

Assign the issue regarding 404 in a11yproject to Roshanjossey.

## RM

Thoughts: The final page snapshot shows the Assignee on the right sidebar set to "Roshan Jossy" (with avatar) and the issue was created by the same user; this indicates the issue is already assigned to that person. Therefore the requested assignment to Roshanjossey was completed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prefer the assigned/filtered list view for checking items assigned to you" — I will not use this right now because the immediate step is to open the a11yproject repository to find its issues. I may use this memory later if I need to filter issues assigned to Roshanjossey.
===============INFO - Memory 1 ("Prefer the assigned/filtered list view for checking items assigned to you"): I will not use this memory right now because I need to find and assign a specific issue to Roshanjossey (not just view items already assigned to me).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It suggests using an "assigned to me" filtered view to see items already assigned to me — not relevant because I need to assign this specific issue to Roshan, and the issue is visible in the list.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (assigned/filtered list view) — Not needed: we're already on the specific issue page and just need to set the Assignee on this issue.
===============INFO - I'll check the memories first:
