## Intent

Search for "switch accessories"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the search box with "switch accessories" and pressed Enter. The final page clearly shows "Search results for: 'switch accessories'" with items listed (Items 1-12 of 13792), so the search was performed successfully and results are displayed.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Search directly for the institution name) — not relevant for this task (we're searching for product accessories, not an institution), so I will not use it.
