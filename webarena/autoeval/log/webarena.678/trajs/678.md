## Intent

Lookup orders that are canceled

## RM

Thoughts: The Orders page shows "Active filters: Status: Canceled" and the table lists orders with Status "Canceled" (and shows "147 records found"), so the agent successfully applied the filter and displayed the canceled orders. This satisfies the user's intent to look up canceled orders.  
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they are directly relevant to finding and reporting cancelled orders and any newer orders that might affect the interpretation:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to check whether any cancelled orders are newer than the latest active order. This is relevant when reporting results so I will apply it after I load the orders list.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check for newer cancelled orders relative to latest active order" — I will use this memory later when I report results so I can highlight if any cancelled orders are newer than the most recent non-cancelled order. For now it doesn't change the UI action but will shape how I present the cancelled orders.
