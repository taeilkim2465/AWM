## Intent

Invite Jakub K, Alex Dills, Alex Hutnik and Benoît Blanchon as collaborator to my time tracking tool project repo

## RM

Thoughts: The invite modal shows an error "Please add members to invite" and the username field is outlined in red even though the names were typed. The Invite button is disabled (greyed out), indicating the users were not selected/recognized (GitLab requires selecting suggestions or valid email addresses). Therefore the members were not actually invited and the action failed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items that remind me to check existing collaborators/pending invites and to inspect the Members page before inviting — that avoids duplicate invites.
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories to guide the next step:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Verify existing collaborators and pending invitations first" — I will use this. We should check current members and pending invites before sending any new invitations to avoid duplicates.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Verify existing collaborators and pending invitations first" — I will use this memory because we should check current members and pending invites before sending new invitations to avoid duplicates.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they all remind me to check existing collaborators and pending invitations before sending new invites — that avoids duplicates and ensures I manage permissions correctly.
===============INFO - I will use the memories that remind me to check current collaborators and pending invites before sending new invitations (Memory 1 and Memory 3). These are relevant so I don't send duplicate invites. Memory 2 isn't directly needed right now because the user didn't ask for a list of current members excluding themselves, but I'll still verify current members as part of checking existing access.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows before inviting new collaborators:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items that remind me to check current collaborators and pending invites before sending new invites.
===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories that remind me to check current collaborators and pending invites before sending new invitations.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will verify existing collaborators and pending invites before sending invites. I inspected the Members table and only saw my account (Byte Blaze), so there are no duplicates or pending invites.
