## Intent

Where is the nearest gas station from CMU 

## RM

Thoughts: This was an information-seeking task ("nearest gas station from CMU"). The action history and final map show a long 605 km route and a distant pin (not a nearby gas station), and there is no extracted answer or statement that no nearby gas station info is available. The agent never presented the nearest gas station location or distance from CMU, so it failed to satisfy the user's request.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I'll use the page search to find nearby gas stations around Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 to make sure I identify and verify the actual nearest gas station to Carnegie Mellon University by running a structured nearby-POI search centered on CMU and selecting the closest result. I will not use Memory 2 right now because the user only asked for the nearest gas station, not travel times or mode-specific routes (I can compute travel times later if you want).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Confirm the nearest POI before computing directions) because it reminds me to run a structured nearby-POI search centered on the origin and pick the nearest result rather than relying on a free-text assumption. I will also use Memory 3 (Find and verify the nearest facilities using geolocation and prioritized candidates) because it recommends geocoding the origin and searching nearby — helpful here. I will not use Memory 2 right now (Compute travel times per transportation mode) because first I need to find and verify the nearest gas station(s); routing and mode-specific travel times can come after we identify candidates.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories that guide how to pick and verify the nearest POI before routing.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It advises verifying the actual nearest POI by running a structured nearby search centered on the geocoded origin — I'll run the directions/search and then check the returned POIs and distances rather than assuming a result.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm the nearest POI before computing directions): I will use this. We should identify the actual nearest gas station to CMU rather than relying on an ambiguous route result (the current directions go far away).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they instruct me to run a nearby-POI search centered on the geocoded origin (Carnegie Mellon University) and pick the nearest gas station rather than guessing. I will not use Memory 2 right now because computing travel times for each transport mode and verifying official hours is more than is needed at this moment and isn't supported by the current page UI.
