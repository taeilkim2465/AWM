{"id": 743, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The sidebar shows a project named \"web_arena\", so the project creation step appears to have succeeded. However the final page is the \"New Issue\" screen (not a members overview) and there is no visible confirmation or member list showing Abishek and Vinta were added. The action history includes attempts to search/add users but is ambiguous and the snapshot provides no evidence the two users were successfully added. Because both creating the project and adding the specified members were required, and member addition is not verifiable, the overall task is a failure.", "status": "failure"}}
