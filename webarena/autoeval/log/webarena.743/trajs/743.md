## Intent

Create a new public project "web_arena" and add Abishek, Vinta as members

## RM

Thoughts: The sidebar shows a project named "web_arena", so the project creation step appears to have succeeded. However the final page is the "New Issue" screen (not a members overview) and there is no visible confirmation or member list showing Abishek and Vinta were added. The action history includes attempts to search/add users but is ambiguous and the snapshot provides no evidence the two users were successfully added. Because both creating the project and adding the specified members were required, and member addition is not verifiable, the overall task is a failure.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites): I will use this later when adding members to avoid duplicate invites, but not for the next immediate action. So: plan to use later, not now.
===============INFO - I will decide whether to use each memory item before taking any action:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1: it's relevant to avoid duplicate invites — I'll check the project's Members view for existing members or pending invites before inviting Abishek and Vinta.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites) is directly relevant — I should open the Members view and search to avoid duplicate invites. I will use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites before inviting): I will use this memory. The members page is already open, so I should confirm Abishek and Vinta are not already listed or pending before sending invites to avoid duplicates.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (check current members/pending invites) because I should verify Abishek and Vinta are not already members before inviting them. I will use Memory 3 (check project metadata) to confirm the project visibility is Public (the page already shows "Project visibility: Public"). I will NOT use Memory 2 (merge request check) because it's not relevant to inviting members.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I should check current members and pending invites before inviting Abishek and Vinta to avoid duplicate invites.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites before inviting): I will use this memory — it's important to avoid duplicate invites. However, instead of running a separate filter now (which would add extra steps), I'll open the "Invite members" flow which will let me add multiple users and warn if a user is already a member or invited.
===============INFO - Memory review and decisions:
