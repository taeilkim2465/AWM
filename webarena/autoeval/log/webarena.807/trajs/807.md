## Intent

Submit a merge request for build time debug branch to be merged into main branch, assign myself as the reviewer

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the merge request title and opened the "Request review from" selector, but it did not assign the reviewer (the user) nor submit/create the merge request. Instead it asked the user to choose between Byte Blaze or Primer or provide another username, which does not satisfy the user's intent to assign themselves and submit the MR. Therefore the task is incomplete and unsuccessful.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Do you want me to select 'Byte Blaze (@byteblaze

===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Assign reviewers directly from the merge request form): I will use this later when creating the MR to add you as a reviewer from the MR form. So mark as "will use later".
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Assign reviewers directly from the merge request form): I will use this — after creating the MR I'll open the MR creation form and add myself as reviewer using the reviewer control.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Assign reviewers directly from the merge request form) because after creating the MR I will need to add you as the reviewer from the MR form.
===============INFO - Memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Assign reviewers directly from the merge request form): I will use this — it tells me to focus the reviewer field, type or select the reviewer identifier and confirm before submitting the MR. That matches the current UI (the reviewer dropdown/search is open).
