## Intent

Tell me the coordinates of Western Pennsylvania Hospital Heliport in DD format

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the heliport's coordinates. The action history shows repeated searches but the final webpage snapshot is just the Nominatim search page with an empty search box and a world map — no search results or coordinate information are visible. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to return the coordinates or state they are unavailable; it did neither. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to return coordinates in DD with hemisphere labels; I will follow this when I provide the final answer.
