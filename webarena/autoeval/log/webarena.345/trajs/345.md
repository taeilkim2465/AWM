## Intent

How many reviews our shop received in Apr 2023?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent set the date range to 04/01/2023–04/30/2023, applied the filter, and the page snapshot clearly shows "351 records found" in the Reviews grid. The agent's message correctly reports that value and offers next steps. Therefore the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'I see 351 reviews for April 2023 (the Reviews grid shows "351 records found" for the date range 04/01/2023 – 04/30/2023

===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (check navigation badges before loading full lists) because it suggests looking at menu counts or badges to quickly find totals; that could help if the Marketing menu shows a badge for reviews. I will not use Memory 1 or Memory 2 because those concern reporting sentiment breakdowns for extracted review sentences, which is not needed — the user only asked for the number of reviews in April 2023.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (reporting sample context): Not needed for just getting the count of reviews in April 2023, so I will not use it now.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about reporting sentiment/sampling context for extracted sentences, which is not needed for a simple count.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 (check navigation badges/counts) because it can save time if a count is visible. Memories 1 and 2 about reporting sampling context are not needed right now — first I need to get to the reviews list for April 2023 to find the count.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (report sampling context for extracted sentences): Not needed — I'm only returning the count, not extracting sentences.
