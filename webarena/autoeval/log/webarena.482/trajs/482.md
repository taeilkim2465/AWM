## Intent

yjlou wants to check my dotfile configurations. Please invite him to the repo as a guest.

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a success banner "Members were successfully added" and the members list includes "yjlou" as a Direct member with Max role set to "Guest" (and a Remove member button visible). The action sequence includes searching and adding yjlou. These indicate the invite was completed and yjlou was added as a guest.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 (they both remind me to check current members before inviting to avoid duplicate invites). I will not use Memory 3 because it's about confirming repo creation details and next steps, which isn't relevant right now.
===============INFO - Memory 1 and Memory 2 are useful here: I should check the current project members before sending an invite to avoid duplicate invites. I will use those memories. Memory 3 (reporting creation details) is not relevant for this step.
===============INFO - I should check the project members list before inviting to avoid duplicate invites.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to avoid duplicate invites by checking the current member list first — the Members table is visible and shows Abishek S and Byte Blaze, so yjlou is not present. I will not use Memory 3 because we don't need repo creation details or next steps right now; we only need to invite a collaborator.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check members before inviting" — I will use this. It advises to view the current member list first to avoid duplicate invites.
===============INFO - I will follow the guidance in the memory items to avoid duplicate invites: check the current member list first (Memory 1 and Memory 2 are relevant). Memory 3 (confirm creation details) is not needed right now.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check members before inviting): I will use this — I already inspected the members list on the page and confirmed yjlou is not present, so inviting is appropriate.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I should check members before inviting to avoid duplicates. The members table is visible and currently lists "Abishek S" and "Byte Blaze"; yjlou is not present, so it's safe to invite.
