## Intent

Increase the price of black fitness tshirts from Desiree with size XS by 37%

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for "Desiree", opened the Desiree Fitness Tee-XS-Black product, cleared and set the Price field to $32.88, then clicked save. $32.88 is exactly 24.00 * 1.37, so the price was updated to reflect a 37% increase (assuming the original price was $24.00). The final page shows the updated Price = $32.88, so the user's intent was fulfilled.
Status: "success"
