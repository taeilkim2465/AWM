{"id": 270, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The final page shows \"Category: Shoes\" and a Price filter \"$20.00 - $29.99\" applied, so the agent did filter shoes under $30. However there is no \"Men\" or gender filter applied (breadcrumb shows Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry and the \"Now Shopping by\" only lists Shoes and the price), so the results are not restricted to \"men shoes\" as requested. Therefore the user's intent (men shoes under $30) was not fully satisfied.", "status": "failure"}}
