## Intent

Show me products under $30 in "men shoes" category

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows "Category: Shoes" and a Price filter "$20.00 - $29.99" applied, so the agent did filter shoes under $30. However there is no "Men" or gender filter applied (breadcrumb shows Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry and the "Now Shopping by" only lists Shoes and the price), so the results are not restricted to "men shoes" as requested. Therefore the user's intent (men shoes under $30) was not fully satisfied.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide navigation and verification:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I will apply category filters and verify product metadata, so I should navigate to the Men category first and then confirm items are in the men's shoes subcategory.
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories to guide the next actions.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Validate search results against category metadata and use category filters): I will use this — after sorting by price I'll verify each item's price and that the item is in the Shoes / Men context before presenting results.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Validate search results vs category metadata): I will use this. If I end up doing a keyword search or selecting results, I must verify items are actually in the "Men" shoes category and under $30 by checking product metadata on the product pages or visible labels.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Validate search results against category metadata): I will use this. It reminds me to confirm category and price metadata after filtering so I won't rely only on titles.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide the next step:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It reminds me to confirm category and filter metadata — I'll navigate to the Shoes subcategory first (so results are actually "men shoes") rather than relying on keywords.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Validate search results against category metadata): I will use this. I need to ensure results are restricted to the Shoes category before picking products under $30, and the page already shows "Now Shopping by Category: Shoes", so I'll keep checking category metadata after filtering.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I should rely on the site's category and price filters rather than just scanning titles, and verify product metadata after filtering.
