## Intent

Promote auth0/angular-storage to subreddit technology with the description from the repo itself.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the URL, title, body and selected subreddit "technology", but the page displays "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." indicating the submission was blocked and never completed. Although the agent reported the form is ready and offered next-step options, the post was not actually submitted to the subreddit. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'The form is ready (URL, Title, Body, subreddit = technology
