## Intent

What is the date when I made my first purchase on this site?

## RM

Thoughts: The orders page shows "Items 31 to 37 of 37 total", i.e. the oldest page, and the earliest order dates listed are 3/2/22 (two orders on 3/2/22). The agent identified that date and reported it. That satisfies the information-seeking intent.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Your first purchase on this site was made on 3/2/22 (there are orders dated 3/2/22 on the oldest page

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to check the visible order dates and see if they already show the earliest purchase. Memory 2 (map search) is not relevant. Memory 3 (apply date/status filters) may be useful later if the full orders list is long or filter controls exist, but for now I'll open the full orders list to see all orders.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (check listing header and visible dates) because the page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total", so the earliest order is likely on the last page; that tells me pagination is needed. I will not use Memory 2 (map selection) since it's irrelevant, and I will not use Memory 3 (date/status filters) because there are no explicit date filters here.
