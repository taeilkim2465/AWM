## Intent

Change the page title of "Home Page" page on my site to "This is the home page!! Leave here!!".

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the title field was filled with "This is the home page!! Leave here!!" and a save click was performed. The page shows a success message "You saved the page." and the Page Title field (and header) displays the new text, confirming the change was applied.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it directly describes the steps to edit a page title in the page editor (locate title input and save). Memory 2 and Memory 3 are about pagination and listing visibility; they are not needed right now because I'm going to open the Pages list and then edit the specific "Home Page" directly, so I will not use them for this step.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Edit the title field and save changes) because it directly describes how to change the page title once the page editor is open. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 (pagination adjustments) because all pages are visible and the "Home Page" row is already on this page.
