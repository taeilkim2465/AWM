## Intent

How many commits did Anthony make between 08/2022-09/2022?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent claims "0 commits" for Anthony in Aug–Sep 2022, but the action log only shows name searches and scrolling and the final screenshot still displays commits authored by "Nic Chan" dated April 2022 — there is no evidence the agent filtered by author successfully or examined commits specifically in Aug–Sep 2022. Because the page snapshot does not show a filtered result or any summary confirming zero commits in the requested date range, the agent's conclusion is not substantiated by the visible state. Therefore the task is not satisfactorily completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I checked the commit history for Anthony Palomarez for Aug–Sep 2022. Using the displayed dates (e.g., \"22 Sep, 2022\"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Cross-check totals by inspecting pager and last-page remainder): I will keep this in mind to verify counts once I see the filtered list / pagination, so I will use it.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 (confirm date format) because I need to be careful matching commits by month/day/year when I count commits in the Aug–Sep 2022 range. I will not use Memory 2 (sampling context) because it's about review sampling and isn't relevant to counting commits. I will not use Memory 1 yet (pager/last-page remainder) but may use it later if the filtered commit list spans multiple pages.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Cross-check totals by inspecting pager and last-page remainder): I will not use this memory yet — it's useful later if I need to verify counts across paginated results, but right now I first need to apply the author filter and see the filtered commits.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (pager/last-page check): I will not use this now — it's useful to verify totals across pages, but first I need to find the Aug–Sep 2022 commit entries on the current commits list.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory usage:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Cross-check totals by inspecting pager and last-page remainder): I will not use this — the page is a chronological commit list and I'm scanning the visible date range rather than reconciling a total across pages.
