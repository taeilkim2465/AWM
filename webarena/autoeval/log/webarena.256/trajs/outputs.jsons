The action history shows repeated search fills and clicks on a Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) search page, and the final snapshot shows the general map/search page with no search result or link to the museum site.

The page does not show the museum's website (cmoa.org) and the agent did not provide the URL, so the task failed.", "status": "failure"}}
