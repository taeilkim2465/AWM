## Intent

What is the website of Carnegie art museum in pittsburgh

## RM

Thoughts: The user requested the Carnegie Museum of Art website. The agent replied with a direct, correct URL (https://cmoa.org/) and offered to find more details. Although the page snapshot shows a failed map search, the user's information need (the museum website) was fulfilled explicitly. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'The official website for the Carnegie Museum of Art (Pittsburgh

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Inspect listing details/map pop-up) because the OpenStreetMap search can show the museum's listing with hours/contact/website in its details — this is faster and likely to give the website link. I will also use Memory 2 (reasonable default search) because the user didn't specify a source, so starting with a general search on this map is reasonable. I will not use Memory 3 (verify ZIP) because the user only asked for the museum's website, not its address or ZIP.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Inspect listing details before repeating searches): Not useful here — the OpenStreetMap search returned no results, so there is no listing panel to inspect.
