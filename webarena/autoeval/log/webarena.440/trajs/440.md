## Intent

I previously ordered some a make up removal kit during summer 2022 and later cancelled. Can you reorder it for me?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to reorder a make-up removal kit from summer 2022 that was later cancelled. The action history and final screenshot show the agent ended on the "My Orders" page listing only "Complete" orders (dates mostly late 2022–2023) and there is no evidence a summer-2022 cancelled order was located or a "Reorder" action for that cancelled order was completed. Because the cancelled summer 2022 order is not visible and there is no reorder confirmation or product page, the agent did not complete the requested reorder.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (Verify whether a cancelled order can be reordered) because I need to check the cancelled order details for a "reorder" / "buy again" option or product link. I will not use Memory 1 (Capture the trending list) — it's unrelated. I may use Memory 3 (Prefer filters, summaries, and exports) later if I need to filter order history by date (summer 2022) or find orders faster.
