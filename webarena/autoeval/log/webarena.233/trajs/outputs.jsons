{"id": 233, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This is an information-seeking task. The agent's response includes an order number, but the action history shows only click('194') and then an immediate message; the final page snapshot is still the \"My Account\" overview (it does not show the orders list or any order details). There is no evidence the agent actually navigated to or viewed the orders to verify which orders are Complete vs Pending/Canceled. Because the agent provided an answer without reaching or showing the orders page (insufficient actions / no supporting final state), the execution is not validated as successful.", "status": "failure"}}
