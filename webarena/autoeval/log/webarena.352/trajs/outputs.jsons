{"id": 352, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for a listed set of products from the \"nutrition bars and drinks\" category sorted by ascending price (an information-seeking task). The final page shows a search for \"nutrition bars\" with a Category filter set to \"Beverages\" and the Sort By set to \"Price\", but the page snapshot only displays product images (no names or prices visible) and the filter indicates only Beverages was applied (not both nutrition bars and drinks). Also there's no evidence the agent returned a textual, ordered list of products or confirmed ascending order. Because the agent did not provide the requested ordered product information (and appears to have filtered to only Beverages), the task is not completed successfully.", "status": "failure"}}
