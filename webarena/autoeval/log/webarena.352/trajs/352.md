## Intent

List products from nutrition bars and drinks category by ascending price

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for a listed set of products from the "nutrition bars and drinks" category sorted by ascending price (an information-seeking task). The final page shows a search for "nutrition bars" with a Category filter set to "Beverages" and the Sort By set to "Price", but the page snapshot only displays product images (no names or prices visible) and the filter indicates only Beverages was applied (not both nutrition bars and drinks). Also there's no evidence the agent returned a textual, ordered list of products or confirmed ascending order. Because the agent did not provide the requested ordered product information (and appears to have filtered to only Beverages), the task is not completed successfully. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they remind me to verify product category and visible prices from listing cards before including items in the result. Memory 2 (order-detail price computation) is not needed right now because I am browsing category listings, not order details.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify category and price from visible metadata): I will use this. It reminds me to confirm category and price from item titles and displayed prices before listing products.
===============INFO - Memory check:

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. I will verify each product's title and displayed price on the listing before including it in the final results (so I'll rely on visible title and price on the listing cards).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 to ensure I only list items that clearly belong to the requested categories and have visible prices before including them. I will not use Memory 2 because it applies to order-detail pages and computing discounted prices, which isn't relevant here.
