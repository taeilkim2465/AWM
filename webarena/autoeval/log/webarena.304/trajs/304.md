## Intent

How many commits did Eric make between Feb 2023 and May 2023?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only applied an author filter for "Eric" and scrolled to show several March 2023 commits (visible in the snapshot). There is no evidence the agent counted commits or checked the full range Feb–May 2023 (no Feb, Apr, May commits shown and no total provided). For an information-seeking task the agent needed to return the number of commits in that date range or state it's unavailable — it did neither. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (check for date-range selectors and summary totals) because it suggests looking for date-range controls or summary views before inspecting many entries; that could give a direct total. I will not use Memory 1 or Memory 2 for this step (they're about cross-checking totals and sampling context, which are useful later after I can see the full date range or totals).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (pager/last-page check): Not using now — that helps verify totals after we've filtered, but first I need to filter commits to Eric and to the date range. I'll keep this in mind for a later step.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I'll remember to cross-check totals by inspecting page groups and the page end if we need to confirm counts across pages.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Cross-check totals by inspecting pager and last-page remainder): I will use this — if there is pagination I should check it to ensure I count all commits in the date range and confirm where the list breaks across pages.
