What is the top-1 best-selling product type in Quarter 1 2022

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the top-1 best-selling product type for Q1 2022 (info-seeking). The action history shows the agent set Period=Month, From=1/1/22, To=3/31/22 and clicked to show the report, but the final page snapshot only displays the filter inputs and no report results or product ranking. Because the requested information is not present or returned in the final state, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"
