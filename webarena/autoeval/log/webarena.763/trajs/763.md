## Intent

Find the walkway to the closest Trader Joe's from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for Trader Joe's, set routing mode to Foot (OSRM), and generated a walking route from 401 Shady Ave to a Trader Joe's. The directions panel and map show a pedestrian route with distance (959 m) and step-by-step walking instructions, so a usable walkway to Trader Joe's was found. This satisfies the user's intent to find the walkway to the closest Trader Joe's (route displayed and walking mode selected). 
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3 because they advise geocoding the origin to a precise location (address/coords) and then doing a nearby/place search sorted by distance to reliably find the true closest Trader Joe's. I will not use Memory 1 right now because it is a fallback for when no exact match is found; first I'll try the structured geocode + nearby search workflow.

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (If no exact match is found, report findings and offer next steps): I will not use this right now because I should first try a precise, structured search for the origin and nearby POIs. I'll only use this if the search doesn't find a match.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (If no exact match is found...) — I will use this as a fallback: if the directions search doesn't find an exact Trader Joe's or a walking route, I'll report what the page returns and propose next steps (nearby search, manual pick, or different map).
===============INFO - I will try to get a walking route from 401 Shady Ave (Kenmawr Apartments) to the nearest Trader Joe's.
