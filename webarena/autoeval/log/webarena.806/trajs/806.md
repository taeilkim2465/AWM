## Intent

Submit a merge request for a11yproject.com/redesign branch to be merged into markdown-figure-block branch, assign myself as the reviewer

## RM

Thoughts: The final page still shows the target branch field set to "main" with the branch selector open (the desired markdown-figure-block is visible in the list but not selected), and the "Compare branches and continue" button is still present on the New merge request screen. There's no evidence the merge request was actually created/submitted or that a reviewer was assigned to the user. Therefore the requested actions (create MR from a11yproject.com/redesign into markdown-figure-block and assign the user as reviewer) were not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows before taking any action:
===============INFO - I'll use the memories as guidance:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Assign reviewers from MR form): I will use this later when I open the merge request form so I can add you as the reviewer from the reviewer/requested-reviewers control.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Assign reviewers from MR form): I will use this later when I'm on the MR creation/edit form to add you as the reviewer.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Assign reviewers directly from the merge request form): I will use this later when I open the MR form to assign you as reviewer. For now I won't try to assign — first I need to check for an existing MR.
===============INFO - We need to create a new merge request from a11yproject.com/redesign into markdown-figure-block and assign the user as reviewer.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (assign reviewers from MR form) because we will need it later to add you as the reviewer once the MR form is open. I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3 (check for existing MRs first) — but those would require searching the MR list; the current screen is the "New merge request" form so the immediate next step is to select the source branch. I'll still keep the "check for existing MR" memory in mind; if we see a way to search for existing MRs later, we'll do that before final submit.
===============INFO - Memory review:
