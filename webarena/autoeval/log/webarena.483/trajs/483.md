## Intent

Koushik wants to check my dotfile configurations. Please invite him to the repo as a guest.

## RM

Thoughts: The final modal shows "Koushik Dutta" populated and "Guest" selected, but the Invite button is still disabled/unclicked and the invite modal remains open. The action history does not include a successful click on the enabled "Invite" control (only repeated clicks that left the modal open), so the user was not actually invited.  
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3: they both recommend checking the repository's member list before starting an invite flow to avoid duplicate invites. I will not use Memory 2 right now because it describes post-creation reporting, which isn't relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check members before inviting" — I will use this. It advises to view the current member list first to avoid duplicate invites.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 (they both remind me to check the current member list before inviting) so I don't send a duplicate invite. I will not use Memory 2 right now because it concerns reporting repo creation details and next actions after creation, which isn't relevant to inviting a collaborator.
===============INFO - Memory 1 ("Check members before inviting"): I will use this — it reminds me to look at the current member list first to avoid duplicate invites. I inspected the members table and do not see a "Koushik" entry (members listed are Abishek S, Byte Blaze, yjlou), so inviting is appropriate.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check members before inviting" — I will use this. I can see the current members list in the background (Abishek S, Byte Blaze (you), yjlou) and Koushik is not present, so inviting is appropriate.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items that advise checking members before inviting to avoid duplicate invites:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check members before inviting): Use — it reminds me to confirm the member list first to avoid duplicate invites. I see the members table (Abishek S, Byte Blaze, yjlou) and Koushik is not listed, so inviting is appropriate.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check members before inviting): Use — I should confirm we checked the member list first to avoid duplicate invites. The members list visible does not include Koushik, so inviting is appropriate.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they remind me to check the current member list before inviting — I already inspected the members panel and Koushik is not listed, so inviting is appropriate. I will not use Memory 2 because it's about reporting repo creation details which is not relevant here.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 3 (check members before inviting) — I already looked at the members table and Koushik is not listed, so an invite is appropriate. Memory 2 (confirm creation details) is not relevant.
