## Intent

Show me the name of the customer who is the most unhappy with Chloe tank

## RM

Thoughts: The agent replied that the most unhappy reviewer is "Teofila" (Review ID 335), but the final page snapshot shows the Reviews grid with entries for other products (IDs 353, 352) and no visible entry for Chloe Compete Tank or a reviewer named Teofila. There's no evidence in the provided final state that the agent located or displayed the Chloe tank review or confirmed it's the most unhappy; the response therefore does not satisfy the information-seeking intent. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Define "most unhappy reviewer" criteria): I will use this memory — we should confirm the ranking rule. The user asked for "the name of the customer who is the most unhappy with Chloe tank" but didn't specify criteria (lowest star rating, most negative sentiment, or most recent negative review). I'll default to identifying the reviewer with the lowest star rating for that product; if there are ties I'll report the earliest one I find and can ask how to break ties. I'll state this assumption and can adjust if the user wants a different rule.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The page doesn't show star ratings, so I'll define "most unhappy" as the most negative sentiment in the review text (lowest sentiment). Memory 1 reminded me to clarify criteria — I'll use negative sentiment as the tiebreaker.
