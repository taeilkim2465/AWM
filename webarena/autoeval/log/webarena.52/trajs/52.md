Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent selected walking (Foot/OSRM), entered Carnegie Mellon University and Starbucks Craig Street, ran the route, and reported "about 7 minutes" for ~557 m. The final webpage snapshot clearly shows "Distance: 557m. Time: 0:07," matching the agent's message. No missing steps or errors — the requested travel time was provided correctly.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (prefer pedestrian/walking routing profile): Use — this will give a more accurate walking time/distance.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (prefer pedestrian/walking routing) because walking mode gives a realistic walking time. I'll also use Memory 3 (use precise origins and pedestrian profile) — I'll enter Carnegie Mellon University as the origin and the Starbucks on Craig Street as the destination, and switch the routing profile to Foot (OSRM). I will NOT use Memory 2 because it is about counting award winners on a map and isn't relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (prefer pedestrian/walking routing): I will use this — the page is already using the Foot (OSRM) routing profile, which gives appropriate walking estimates.
