===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide creating a site-wide, auto-applied $40 checkout discount rule.
===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories as guidance while creating the rule:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it's directly relevant because you want the $40 checkout discount to apply site-wide and auto‑apply for all customers (so I will select all customer groups and set no-coupon/auto-apply).
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it reminds me to explicitly set customer groups and no-coupon/auto-apply for a site-wide automatic discount — I already selected all customer groups and set "No Coupon", so that aligns with the memory.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (site‑wide auto‑apply): I will use this — the rule already has "No Coupon" and all customer groups/websites selected, which matches this memory.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items to ensure the rule is created correctly and saved.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Configure site‑wide, auto‑applied discounts explicitly): I will use this memory — it is relevant because the rule should apply to all customers and be auto‑applied (no coupon). From the grid I can already see the "Coupon Code" column is empty for the "Thanksgiving Sale - $40 off" row, and earlier I selected all customer groups and the Main Website, so I want to confirm those settings in the rule details.
