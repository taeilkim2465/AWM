## Intent

I am at CMU Pittsburgh, how long it takes to drive to the nearest Mcdonald's

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled origin (Carnegie Mellon University) and destination (McDonald's), requested driving directions (OSRM), and returned the driving distance and time in its message. The page snapshot confirms "Distance: 2.1km. Time: 0:04." and shows the route and turn-by-turn steps, so the requested information (driving time to the nearest McDonald's from CMU as computed) was provided. No errors or missing actions for an information-seeking task. 
Status: "success"
