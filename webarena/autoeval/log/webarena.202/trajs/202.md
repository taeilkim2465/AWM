## Intent

Get the date of the most recent canlled order

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows an active filter "Status: Canceled" and the top order (ID 000000136) has Purchase Date "May 23, 2023 9:20:01 PM", which matches the agent's reported date. The agent successfully filtered and read the most recent canceled order date, so the task is complete.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'The most recent canceled order date is: May 23, 2023 9:20:01 PM.'

===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 because it focuses on locating the latest processing order (status "processing"/pending), but the user specifically asked for the most recent cancelled order.
===============INFO - I will use the memories that describe how to find the most recent order by status and date, because they are relevant to finding the most recent cancelled order:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it specifically targets "processing" orders, but the user asked for the most recent cancelled order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it concerns locating processing orders (pending/processing). The user asked for the most recent cancelled order, so Memory 1 is irrelevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Locate the latest processing order) — I will not use this. It's specific to "processing" orders, while the user asked for the most recent "canceled" order.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items that talk about filtering and sorting by status/date, and skip the one about "processing" orders because that's not relevant to this request.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Locate the latest processing order) — I will NOT use this (it's about processing/pending orders, not canceled).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not used — it’s about locating the latest processing order (status = processing), but the user asked for the most recent canceled order.
