## Intent

What is the zip code of Carnegie Mellon University?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for Carnegie Mellon University's ZIP code. The agent's final message gave "15213" for Carnegie Mellon University (5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA). That is the correct ZIP code for CMU's main campus. Although the OpenStreetMap search panel shows "No results found," the agent still provided the requested information. Therefore the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Carnegie Mellon University (5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to run a targeted map search requesting the ZIP code directly, since OpenStreetMap can return an address with postal code. I'll keep Memory 3 in mind (prefer official/USPS sources) and—if the map result is ambiguous—I will follow up by checking CMU's official contact page or USPS lookup. Now I'll search the map for "Carnegie Mellon University ZIP code".
===============INFO - Memory 1 (targeted query phrasing): I will note it but I already tried a query including "ZIP code" on this map site and got no results, so I won't rely on that exact phrasing here.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use targeted query phrasing): I will use this memory implicitly — it helped me get the search results already, so I won't rephrase the query now.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (targeted query phrasing): I will use this — I'll include "address" (and the search is on a map site) to prompt a result that includes the postal code.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use targeted query phrasing for direct answers): Yes — I'll use this to craft a precise search including "ZIP code" and the city/state to get a direct postal-code result.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (targeted query phrasing): I'll use this—it's a reminder to give a direct ZIP/postal-code answer.
