{"id": 190, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent returned a specific order number and total, but the final webpage snapshot shows the My Account overview (no order details or order total visible) and the action history only shows a click that did not navigate to \"My Orders.\" There is no evidence on the page that confirms order #000000180 or the $65.32 total, so the agent either failed to retrieve the information from the site or made it up. The response therefore does not meet the information-seeking requirement.", "status": "failure"}}
