## Intent

Find the page of the longest bridge in the Western hemisphere on the map.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent repeatedly entered bridge-related queries (Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, Pontchartrain Causeway, etc.) and clicked, but the final snapshot shows only the Nominatim search form and a world map with no search result or bridge page displayed. The user's goal was to find the map page for the longest bridge in the Western Hemisphere, which was not reached or shown. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll search the map for the longest bridge in the Western Hemisphere. My memory items are about traversing paginated reviews and opening canonical posts — they don't apply to this map search, so I won't use them.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (exhaustively traverse paginated reviews) — Not relevant, I will not use it because this task is about finding a map page, not scanning reviews.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (exhaustively traverse paginated reviews) — not relevant for this task (we're searching a map, not browsing paginated reviews), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Exhaustively traverse paginated reviews before concluding" — Not relevant for this step (we're searching the map, not scanning paginated reviews). I will not use it.
