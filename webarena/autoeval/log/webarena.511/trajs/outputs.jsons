The agent only filled the search box with \"laundry detergent\" and clicked the search button, landing on the search results page. There is no action selecting a product or clicking an \"Add to Wish List\" button, and the page shows search results rather than any confirmation that an item was added. Therefore the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
