## Intent

Get the billing name of the oldest complete order

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted the billing name of the oldest order with status "Complete". The action history shows the agent opened the Orders page and expanded Filters (final snapshot shows the filters panel and "308 records found"), but there is no evidence the agent set the Status filter to "Complete", sorted by purchase date ascending, or opened any specific order to view its billing name. The page snapshot does not display any order details or a billing name. Therefore the requested information was not retrieved.
Status: "failure"
