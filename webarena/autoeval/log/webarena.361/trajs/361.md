## Intent

Show me the order statuses for order number 170 and 189.

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent's message lists the status for order 000000170 (Canceled) and order 000000189 (Pending), which directly answers the user's request for those order statuses. Therefore the agent completed the task successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Order 000000170 — Status: Canceled\nOrder 000000189 — Status: Pending\nWould you like me to open either order to view details?'
