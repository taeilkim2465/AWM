The agent's action history shows it clicked around and then asked a clarification about whether to include the fragment \"# Reasoning Memories\" or use the canonical URL; it did not enter or save any homepage value. The visible Edit Profile page snapshot shows the profile edit form but no evidence the homepage field was changed or that the form was submitted. Because the agent only asked a question and did not perform the update or confirm the change, the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
