## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent filled the title, start date (2023-01-16), due date (2023-02-05) and description, clicked to create the milestone, and the final page snapshot confirms a milestone titled "Collective code review practice" with start Jan 16, 2023 and due Feb 5, 2023 (notes present, 0 issues). This matches the user's request to create the milestone for the practice starting 1/16/2023 and ending 20 days later. No errors are observed.

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to convert the user's relative end ("ending in 20 days") into an explicit inclusive due date and avoid off-by-one errors.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. The user gave a specific start date; per this memory I will treat the provided start date as an explicit inclusive start boundary (start = 2023-01-16).
