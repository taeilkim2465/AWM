## Intent

Draft a refund message via their "contact us" form for the bluetooth speaker I bought Feb 2023. It broke after three days of use. The shop requires the order id, the reason and the amount to refund in the message. Don't submit yet

## RM

Thoughts: The agent produced a clear refund draft message containing the required elements: Order ID (placeholder present), reason (speaker defective after three days / purchase date Feb 2023), and requested refund amount (placeholder present). It did not submit the form (user asked "Don't submit yet") and offered follow-up details (photos, return instructions). The page snapshot is the site homepage but doesn't affect the draft. Therefore the task (drafting the refund message) is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Subject: Refund request — Bluetooth speaker (Order ID: [ORDER_ID]

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: "State the requested refund amount and the reason clearly" — I will use this. The shop requires amount and reason, so the draft will explicitly state both and avoid ambiguity.
