## Intent

Where is the nearest In-N-Out to Upitts, and what is the walking distance to it?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the nearest In-N-Out to "Upitts" and the walking distance. This is an information-seeking task. The agent only performed repeated OpenStreetMap searches (no results) and then sent a clarifying question asking whether "Upitts" means University of Pittsburgh and asking permission to search the wider web. The agent did not provide the requested location or walking distance, nor did it explicitly state that the information is unavailable overall (only that OSM had no results). Because the user’s request was not satisfied and the agent has not completed the search or given the final answer, the execution is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'Quick question before I proceed: by "Upitts" do you mean the University of Pittsburgh campus? Also, OpenStreetMap search returned no In-N-Out results for the area. May I search the wider web (e.g., Google Maps

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories because they are directly relevant to finding the nearest In-N-Out by walking distance and ensuring we pick the truly nearest location by computed pedestrian route rather than relying on list order.
===============INFO - The search for "Upitts" returned no results on OpenStreetMap. I should try a likely interpretation — "University of Pittsburgh" — and search for that, then search for nearby "In-N-Out" and compute walking directions.
===============INFO - I will use the page search box to look for "In-N-Out" near the University of Pittsburgh.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this later — after I find candidate In-N-Out locations I'll compute walking routes and compare actual walking distances.
