## Intent

Assign the issue regarding flash alert in primer design guide repo to myself.

## RM

Thoughts: The issue page's right sidebar shows "Assignee" set to Byte Blaze (the user's account), indicating the issue is assigned to the user. The top banner ("Failed to assign...") likely reflects an earlier attempt, but the final state shows the user as assignee, so the task was completed.
Status: "success"
