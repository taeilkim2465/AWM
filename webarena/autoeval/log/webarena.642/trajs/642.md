## Intent

Post a notice on a virtual meetup for Big little lies enthusiasts on Sep 10th in the books subreddit

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the title/body, selected r/Books and attempted to submit, but the page shows the error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The form is still visible and no evidence of a successful submission is present, so the post was not created.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I can’t submit the post right now because the site shows a posting restriction.\n\nNotice shown: “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.”\n\nThe form is filled as follows:\n- Title: Virtual Meetup: Big Little Lies — Sep 10 (Virtual

## Captions

===============INFO - I will open the submission form so I can create the meetup post in the books subreddit.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3 because they warn about posting restrictions and rate limits; it's important to check for any visible notices or permission requirements before submitting the post. I will NOT use Memory 1 because it concerns counting book recommendations in posts, which is unrelated to creating this meetup notice.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (count distinct recommendations) is not relevant to posting this meetup, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the full original post and count only distinct recommendations): Not relevant for this step — it concerns analyzing other posts' contents, not posting restrictions. I will not use it.
