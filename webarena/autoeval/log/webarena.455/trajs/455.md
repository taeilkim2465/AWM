## Intent

Disable lHelios Endurance Tank from the site, they are facing some quality issues.

## RM

Thoughts: The goal was to disable the "Helios Endurance Tank". The final page shows the "Enable Product" toggle set to "No", and the action history includes a final click (ID '892') which corresponds to the Save button. The product is therefore turned off and saved — the requested change was applied.

Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (date format) — Not relevant for disabling a product, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the UI's expected date format) — Not relevant for this step (we're navigating to the product list, not entering dates), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - I will use the product listing row for "Helios Endurance Tank" and open its edit page to change its Status to Disabled.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to use the UI's expected formats and avoid conflicting inputs — relevant if any date or period fields were involved, but not directly needed here. I will still note it and not change any date fields.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (date format) is not relevant for this action — I will not use it.
