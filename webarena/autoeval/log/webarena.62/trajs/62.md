## Intent

Which customer has completed the most number of orders in the entire history?

## RM

Thoughts: The Order Count Report page is empty — it shows "We can't find records for this period" and no customer/order rows are listed. Since the user asked which customer has the most completed orders historically and the page contains no data (and the agent did not adjust the date range to cover the entire history or return the requested name/count), the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Exhaustively check pagination) because to determine which customer has the most orders I must examine all pages (there are 308 records across 2 pages). I will not use Memory 2 (unrelated: universities) or Memory 3 (similar but redundant) for this step.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Exhaustively check pagination): I will use this. We must be sure to consider all pages or the full result set before reporting who has the most completed orders.
