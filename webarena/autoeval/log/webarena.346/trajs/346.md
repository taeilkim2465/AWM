## Intent

How many reviews our shop received during 2022?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the Created date range 01/01/2022 → 12/31/2022 and ran the Reviews grid. The page snapshot shows the grid message "We couldn't find any records" and the agent reported "0 records found" for that date range. The response directly answers the user's question (0 reviews in 2022) and offers sensible next steps if the user wants further verification. This satisfies the information-seeking task.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I checked the Reviews grid with the Created date range 01/01/2022 → 12/31/2022. The admin shows “0 records found” (message: “We couldn't find any records.”

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this — it reminds me to report how many reviews I inspected and the sentiment breakdown when I extract review sentences or summarise criticisms.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will filter the reviews list by Created date to cover the entire 2022 year and then run the search to get the count.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Do not use — it suggests reporting sentiment breakdown for extracted sentences; not relevant because the user only asked for a count.
