## Intent

Among the top 10 post in "books" forum, show me the book names from posts that recommand a single book

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for book names from top-10 "books" forum posts that recommend a single book. The action history shows three clicks and the final page snapshot displays an article/header "The Eliot–Hale Letters" and a large portrait, not a list of the top-10 posts or any post content listing single-book recommendations. No book titles or evidence of having extracted recommendations are present in the final state. Therefore the agent did not fulfill the information-seeking task.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it instructs to open each post's full view to verify whether it recommends exactly one book — that's directly relevant to deciding which posts qualify. I'll use Memory 2 as supportive (if I need author links or canonical URLs while opening posts), though the user only asked for book names so author links aren't required now. I'll use Memory 3 to remember to confirm sorting/filter if needed (we need the "top 10" posts; after opening the books forum I'll check the sort control and the listing to ensure I'm looking at the intended top posts).
===============INFO - I will follow Memory 1 and open each top post in full view (one at a time) to inspect the post body and confirm whether it recommends exactly one book. I will record the book title when a post clearly recommends a single book.
