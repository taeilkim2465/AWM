## Intent

Post in books subreddit about what could machine learning help the correpong field.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened the "Create submission" page (action 1) and asked the user clarifying questions about title, body, which field was meant by "correpong", tone, and constraints (action 2). The submission form in the final snapshot is still empty (no title/body, forum not selected) and no submission was created. For a content-modification task (posting), the agent needed to fill in the fields and submit the post; it did not. 
Status: "failure"

User Intent: Post in books subreddit about what could machine learning help the correpong field.

Action History:
1: click('63')
2: send_msg_to_user('I opened the submission page. Before I create the post in r/books, what title and body would you like? A few helpful details: 1) Confirm you want a text post in the books subreddit. 2) Clarify what you meant by "correpong field" (typo — do you mean "corresponding field" or a specific field like “publishing”, “literary criticism”, “education”, etc.?). 3) Do you want a neutral/academic tone or a casual/open-ended discussion? 4) Any constraints (length, examples, tags, flairs)? If you want, I can suggest a short title and a detailed body draft that uses targeted questions to encourage replies.')
