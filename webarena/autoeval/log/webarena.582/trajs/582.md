## Intent

Create a new forum named Cyberpunk, with a description of Welcome to the future, and include ['Games', 'Books', 'Movies', 'Future'] in the sidebar?

## RM

Thoughts: The forum /f/cyberpunk was created (title visible and "Created 0 seconds ago"), and the sidebar contains the bullet list Games, Books, Movies, Future, so the name and sidebar items were applied. However the provided description "Welcome to the future" is not visible anywhere on the page snapshot (no description shown under the title or in the sidebar), so the requested description does not appear to have been set/displayed. Because one required element is missing, the task is not fully completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Fill both identifier fields when creating a forum): I will use this — when we reach the forum creation form I should set both the display name and the internal slug/identifier.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Fill both identifier fields when creating a forum): I will use this — the form has a Name (internal/slug) and a Title (visible name), so I'll populate both to keep them consistent.
