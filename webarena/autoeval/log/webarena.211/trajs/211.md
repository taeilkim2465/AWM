Thoughts: The screenshot shows one record matching the search with Name "Sean Miller", Email "sean.miller@gmail.com", and Phone "8015551212". The agent's message correctly reported those fields and found the matching customer. This satisfies the information-seeking intent.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide the search:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (check multiple contact fields) — I will use this later when I open a customer record to inspect billing/contact/account sections for the phone number.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check likely fields for contact information): I will not apply this yet, but I will keep it in mind if I need to open an individual customer record later (check billing/contact/account sections).
===============INFO - Memory 1: I'll use it — it reminds me to check contact/billing/account sections if I need to open the full customer record.
===============INFO - I will consider the provided memory items before acting.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It reminds me to check billing/contact/account sections if I open the full customer record — I'll apply this if you ask me to open the record.
