## Intent

How many reviews our shop received in May 2023?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the Created date filter for 05/01/2023–05/31/2023, ran the search, and the Reviews grid shows "0 records found" with the page displaying "We couldn't find any records." The agent explicitly reported "0 reviews in May 2023," which matches the final page state in the screenshot. This satisfies the information-seeking intent.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I used the Created date filter for 05/01/2023–05/31/2023 and ran the search in the Reviews admin. The grid shows \"0 records found.\" So your shop received 0 reviews in May 2023. Would you like me to broaden the search (e.g., check other statuses, store views, or the entire year

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 because it directly recommends filtering reviews by Created date range to get an authoritative count for a specific period (May 2023). Memory 1 and Memory 2 (about reporting sampling context and sentiment breakdown) are useful when extracting example review text or summarizing sentiment, but they are not needed to answer a simple count of reviews for May 2023.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (set the Created date range filter) because it directly instructs how to get an authoritative count for a specific period. I will not use Memory 1 or Memory 2 because they are about reporting context for extracted sentences (not needed for counting reviews).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Provide sampling context for extracted sentences): Not using — the user only asked for a count, not extracted sentences or sentiment breakdown.
