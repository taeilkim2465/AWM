## Intent

Who else have access to my repo gimmiethat.space, show me their usernames

## RM

Thoughts: The Members page in the screenshot shows only two entries: Byte Blaze (@byteblaze) — you, Owner — and yilou with username @yjlou as a Direct member (Developer). The agent correctly reported the only other user with access as @yjlou and gave matching reasoning, so the information-seeking task was satisfied.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Other users with access (besides you

===============INFO - Memory 1 (top contributor details): I will not use this memory now — the user asked for who has access to the repository (members), not contributor counts.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (top contributor details): I will not use this — it's about commit counts and contributors, not about who has access to the repository.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Report the top contributor..." — I will NOT use this memory now. The user asked who else has access (project members), not who the top contributor is.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (top contributor info): Not relevant to this request (user asked who else has access), so I will not use it.
