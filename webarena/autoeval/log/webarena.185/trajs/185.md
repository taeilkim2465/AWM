## Intent

Give me the brand of the products that have 3 units left

## RM

Thoughts: The grid shows "Active filters: Quantity: 3 - 3" with 2 records found, so the agent filtered correctly. However the product table in the final snapshot does not display a Brand/Manufacturer column and the Columns panel is open showing that the Manufacturer/Brand option is not selected. The visible fields (ID, Name, SKU, etc.) do not explicitly show a brand value (the product names start with words like "Eos" and "Minerva" but the Brand field itself is not visible or extracted). Because the agent did not reveal the Brand/Manufacturer values for the two filtered products, it did not provide the requested information.
Status: "failure"
