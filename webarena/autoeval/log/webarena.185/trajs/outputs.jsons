However the product table in the final snapshot does not display a Brand/Manufacturer column and the Columns panel is open showing that the Manufacturer/Brand option is not selected. The visible fields (ID, Name, SKU, etc.) do not explicitly show a brand value (the product names start with words like \"Eos\" and \"Minerva\" but the Brand field itself is not visible or extracted). Because the agent did not reveal the Brand/Manufacturer values for the two filtered products, it did not provide the requested information.", "status": "failure"}}
