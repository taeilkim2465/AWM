## Intent

Update order #307 with the DHL tracking number 24353446464

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to update order #307 with tracking number 24353446464. The action log and final page show the agent opened order #000000307 and the Shipments tab with "We couldn't find any records." The agent did not add the tracking number; instead it asked the user to confirm since the order is Canceled. Because no tracking was added and the modification was not performed, the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the provided memories to guide behavior:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Ask for explicit confirmation when the order status blocks shipment updates" — I will use this. Before adding tracking, I need to check the order status; if the order is canceled/completed and the UI prevents shipping updates, I must ask you whether to override or proceed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Ask for explicit confirmation when the order status blocks shipment updates" — I will keep this in mind and plan to use it if the order page shows the order is canceled/completed or otherwise not shippable. For now I will not prompt the user yet because I first need to locate the order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Ask for explicit confirmation when the order status blocks shipment updates" — I will NOT use this now because I haven't yet confirmed the order's status; this memory will become relevant if the system later indicates the order cannot be modified (e.g., canceled/completed) after I locate it.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because the order shown is "Canceled" and the memories instruct to verify status and ask for explicit confirmation before making shipping/ tracking changes:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the provided memory items because they all emphasize verifying the order identity and status before making shipping changes — that's important here since the Shipments tab shows "We couldn't find any records." Specifically:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It says to ask for explicit confirmation when the order status blocks shipment updates. The order page shows "Order Status: Canceled", so I should ask you before attempting to add or change shipment/tracking information.
