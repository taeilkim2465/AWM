## Intent

From my stay at Homewood Suites Southpointe, what's the estimated driving time to reach PPG Paints Arena?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the origin and destination, executed the directions query, and reported "Distance: 30 km, Time: 0:34" plus the primary route. The left directions panel in the page snapshot clearly shows "Distance: 30km. Time: 0:34.", so the agent provided the requested estimated driving time and relevant route details. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "The directions panel shows: Distance = 30 km (≈ 18.6 mi

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it says to report both distance and estimated driving time, which is directly relevant.
