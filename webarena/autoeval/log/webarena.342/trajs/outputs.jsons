{"id": 342, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This is an information-seeking task. The agent did apply a filter (filled \"opt label:question\") and then opened the \"Export issues\" dialog showing \"95 issues selected\", but it did not list the issue titles or otherwise return the requested information to the user. Initiating an export that will be emailed later is not the same as presenting the list now. Because the agent never provided the actual list of open OPT-related question issues (nor stated it's unavailable), the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
