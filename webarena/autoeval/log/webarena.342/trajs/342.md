## Intent

List all opened issues that ask about OPT model related questions

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent did apply a filter (filled "opt label:question") and then opened the "Export issues" dialog showing "95 issues selected", but it did not list the issue titles or otherwise return the requested information to the user. Initiating an export that will be emailed later is not the same as presenting the list now. Because the agent never provided the actual list of open OPT-related question issues (nor stated it's unavailable), the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will open the repository's Issues list to filter and find open issues about the OPT models.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the repository's Issues list as the canonical place for label-based views): I will use this — the Issues list is already open and is the right place to apply a text filter/search for "opt".
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (start from the repository's Issues list) because I'm already on the Issues list page — that is the right place to filter and collect label/search results. I will also use Memory 3 (verify open/closed status and pagination) because the user asked for open issues and I need to ensure I capture all matching open issues across the page(s).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the repository's Issues list as canonical): I will use this — we're already on the repository's Issues list which supports label/term filtering and is the right view to list issues.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use the repository's Issues list) because we're already on the Issues list and that is the canonical place to apply label-based filters. I will also use Memory 3 (verify results are complete and limited to open issues) to ensure the Open tab and full result set are shown (we may need to refresh the search to be safe). I will not use Memory 2 because mapping to an admin section is not relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the repository's Issues list as the canonical place for label-based views): I will use this — we're already on the repository Issues list and the search is applied, so this is the correct view to extract label-filtered issues.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use the repository's Issues list) because we're already on the Issues list and the search/filter is applied there — this is the correct place to get a label-filtered view. I will also use Memory 3 (verify results are complete and limited to open issues) — after closing the export dialog I should confirm we're on the Open tab and that the filter "opt label:question" is applied and that all results are visible (pagination set to show 100 items covers the 95 results).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the repository's Issues list) — I will use this. We're already on the repository Issues list view which is the canonical place to filter by label and get the consolidated results.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the repository's Issues list as the canonical place for label-based views): Use — we're already on the repository Issues list and this is the right view to get label-filtered issues.
