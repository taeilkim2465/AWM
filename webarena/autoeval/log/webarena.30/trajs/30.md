## Intent

Tell me the count of comments that have received more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the space forum.

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot shows the Comments tab for InternationalBack472 with four visible comments; their score badges read 2, 1, 1, and 1 (all nonnegative), so none have more downvotes than upvotes. The agent explicitly said it counted the visible comments and reported 0, and offered to load older comments if needed. That satisfies the information-seeking requirement given the visible data.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1, 2, and 3 are relevant and I will use them:
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories about vote displays because they are directly relevant: the comment listings show a single number between the upvote/downvote controls which should be interpreted as the net score (upvotes minus downvotes). That means a negative net number indicates a comment with more downvotes than upvotes.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me that a single vote number shown is the net score (upvotes minus downvotes), so a negative value means more downvotes than upvotes. This is directly applicable.
