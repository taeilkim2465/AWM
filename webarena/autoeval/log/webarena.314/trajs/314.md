## Intent

List the name of the top 3 contributors to prime/design repo, ranked by the number of commits?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent returned a ranked list of the top three contributors with commit counts and emails. The webpage snapshot clearly shows Shawn Allen (95) and Inayaili León (77) matching the agent's output; the third entry (Aurora Pleguezuelo — 66) is plausible given the page layout and the agent's interactions. The response contains the requested information and is ordered by commits, so the task is satisfied.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Top 3 contributors to the Primer/design repo, ranked by commits:\n1. Shawn Allen — 95 commits (shawn.allen@github.com

===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It asks to include full name, exact commit count, and an identifier when reporting top contributors. I should gather those details once I can see the contributors list or individual commit counts.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it requests including full name, exact commit count, and an identifier — which the page shows next to each contributor.
