## Intent

How much refund I should expect from my order canlled in May 2023 if I cannot get the shipping fee refunded?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent located the canceled May 17, 2023 order, read the item prices (250.80 + 40.99 + 58.63 = 350.42) and the $15.00 shipping charge, and clearly stated the expected refund if shipping is not refunded ($350.42). The page snapshot confirms the item subtotals add to $350.42 and the order is canceled, so the agent's calculation and answer match the page data and directly satisfy the user's question.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Summary and expected refund:\n\n- Order date: May 17, 2023\n- Payment method: Check / Money order (refund may be issued by check and take longer
