## Intent

Re-post the image of Bald Eagle in this page to earthporn subreddit and note "from /f/pics"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only clicked the image and asked the user for confirmation/details (account, title, placement of "from /f/pics", flair) but did not actually repost the image to r/EarthPorn. For a content-modification task (posting), the required action — creating the Reddit post — was not performed, so the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (Compose concise posts and follow community posting rules) because it reminds me to write a short, appropriate post and check subreddit requirements before submitting. I will not use Memory 1 (scope when reporting aggregated metric) — it isn't relevant to reposting an image. I will not use Memory 2 (verify product capacity/layout) — it's unrelated.
