## Intent

set the homepage URL on my GitLab profile to a11yproject.contributor.me

## RM

Thoughts: The agent did save the profile (page shows "Profile was successfully updated"), but the value it entered was "https://a11yproject.contributor.me#Reasoning%20Memories" (includes https and a fragment with an encoded space) rather than the exact homepage URL requested ("a11yproject.contributor.me"). Because the modified field does not match the user's specified URL, the task did not complete as requested.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Done — your GitLab profile Website URL is set to https://a11yproject.contributor.me#Reasoning%20Memories (the space in the fragment was URL-encoded

===============INFO - Memory 1 (sanitize canonical URL) is relevant — I will use it. I will ensure the homepage field receives a clean canonical URL (include scheme, no annotations).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Sanitize and only paste the canonical value into profile fields): Use — this is directly relevant. The user provided "a11yproject.contributor.me# Reasoning Memories" which contains a trailing comment; I should strip that and include the URL with scheme (https://) when setting the homepage field.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (sanitize and paste canonical value) because the website URL field should receive a clean, properly formatted URL (including scheme, no extra commentary or stray whitespace). I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because they are about routing profiles and pedestrian routing and are not relevant to editing a profile field.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. It says to sanitize and paste the canonical URL. I followed that by including the scheme (https://) and URL-encoding the space in the fragment as %20.
