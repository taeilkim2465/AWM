## Intent

See all public projects

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the Projects > Explore page and the final snapshot shows a list of projects (Explore tab active). This page displays public projects (and includes a Visibility dropdown currently set to "Any"), so the user can view public projects as requested. The navigation therefore achieves the intent to see public projects.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to confirm I'm on the correct projects view and that the project entries show role and star count — that's relevant for ensuring I can see public projects and their details. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because they relate to pricing and saving profile changes, which are not relevant to viewing public projects.
