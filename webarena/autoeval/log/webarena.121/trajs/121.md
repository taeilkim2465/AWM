===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (Infer customer appeal from product attributes) because direct customer reviews may not be available and attribute signals will help explain why customers like the Circe hooded fleece. I'll also use Memory 3 (Check commerce signals that drive purchases) because price, availability, variants, and promotions are important reasons customers prefer a product. I will not use Memory 2 (Include explicit reply instructions) because it's not necessary for this step.
