## Intent

Post "close because non reproducible" for the merge request related to focus edge cases in a11yproject/a11yproject.com project

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the comment field filled with "close because non reproducible" and the final page snapshot displays a new comment from Byte Blaze reading "close because non reproducible". That indicates the agent successfully posted the requested message to the merge request thread. 
Status: "success"
