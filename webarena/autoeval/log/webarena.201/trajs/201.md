## Intent

Get the customer name of the earliest fraud suspect order

## RM

Thoughts: The agent correctly applied the "Status: Suspected Fraud" filter (actions show selecting that option) and the final page snapshot clearly shows "Active filters: Status: Suspected Fraud" and "0 records found" / "We couldn't find any records." The user's request was to get the customer name of the earliest suspected-fraud order; the agent explicitly reported that no orders match that status and therefore there is no earliest suspected-fraud order to extract a customer name from, and it offered next steps. This satisfies the information-seeking requirement by explicitly stating the information is not available given the current data. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I checked the Orders list with the filter Status: Suspected Fraud applied — the page shows “0 records found” and the table says “We couldn't find any records.” Therefore there are currently no orders with Status = Suspected Fraud, so there is no earliest suspected-fraud order to extract a customer name from. Would you like me to clear the filter and search all orders or try a different status/date range?"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm customer and status directly from the order detail view) — I will use this memory. It instructs me to open an order's detail panel to read customer name and status before reporting. However, I can only apply it if there is at least one order in the filtered results.
