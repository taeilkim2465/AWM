## Intent

Set up a new, empty repository with the name awesome_webagent?

## RM

Thoughts: The action log shows the name was corrected to "awesome_webagent" and the agent reported creation. The final webpage snapshot clearly displays "Project 'awesome_webagent' was successfully created," Project ID: 196, and the repository is empty. This matches the user's intent to set up a new, empty repository.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Done — I created the project 'awesome_webagent' and confirmed it is empty (no README/ LICENSE/ .gitignore initialized

===============INFO - Memory items:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 to ensure the repository is truly empty by disabling any auto-initialization options (README, .gitignore, license) once the blank project form appears.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ensure initialization settings produce an actually empty repository): I will use this — I must uncheck any initialization options (README, etc.) so the repo is truly empty.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The user requested an empty repo, so I will ensure the "Initialize repository with a README" option is turned off before creating.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. The user asked for an empty repo, so I should verify initialization options were not applied. The page shows "The repository for this project is empty" and the UI offers "Add README / Add LICENSE / Add CHANGELOG" etc., so it appears empty (no README/LICENSE/.gitignore present).
