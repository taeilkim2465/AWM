## Intent

Fill the "contact us" form in the site for a refund on the speaker I bought, stating that it broke after just three days of use. Also, ensure to include the order number #148 and the product SKU. Don't submit yet, I will check.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened and filled the contact form with the refund message and correctly included order #148, left submission undone as requested, and asked the user to provide the actual product SKU. However the message still contains the placeholder "[INSERT SKU]" instead of the required product SKU, so the user's instruction to include the SKU was not fulfilled. Because one required piece (the product SKU) is missing, the task is not fully completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I can update the message to include the actual product SKU, but I don’t have it yet. Please tell me the product SKU to replace [INSERT SKU].\n\nAlso confirm: do you want me to request a full refund (yes — the current message already requests a full refund

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it's directly relevant for wording the defect, timeframe, and refund request; I'll use its guidance when filling the message.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it advises being concise, stating the failure timeline, offering evidence, and asking about return instructions — all relevant for the refund message. I will not use Memory 2 (cancellation confirmation) because this is a refund request, not an order cancellation. I will not use Memory 3 (product page capacity/layout) because it's unrelated.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Be concise about the defect, timeframe, and the refund requested) — I will use this. It helps craft the message (state failure, timeframe, request refund, offer photos, ask about return).
