## Intent

Show me the command to clone metaseq with SSH.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent provided a clear SSH clone command specifically including the GitLab form (git clone git@HOST:namespace/metaseq.git) and examples, which directly satisfies the user's request to show the command to clone metaseq with SSH.

Status: "success"

## Final Response "Here’s a concise, reusable SSH clone command for a repo named \"metaseq\":\n\n- Generic form:\n  git clone <SSH-URL>\n\n- Common SSH URL patterns you can substitute your host/namespace into:\n  git clone git@HOST:namespace/metaseq.git\n  (or with an explicit ssh:// form

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it directly matches the request to provide an SSH clone command in a concise, reusable form. I'll use Memory 2 to offer clear next actions after giving the command. I'll use Memory 3 to include explicit reply instructions so the user can easily pick a next step. No page interaction is needed — just send the command and follow-up options to the user.
