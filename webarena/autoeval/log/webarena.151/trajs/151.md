## Intent

What is the minimum travel time by car from CMU to University of Pittsburgh?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent filled start/end, requested driving directions, and reported "Distance: 2.4 km" and "Time: 0:04 (about 4 minutes)". The page snapshot confirms "Distance: 2.4km. Time: 0:04." The agent provided the requested minimum travel time and noted traffic caveats, so the execution meets the user's intent.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'The OSRM directions on the page show a driving distance of 2.4 km and an estimated driving time of 0:04 (about 4 minutes

===============INFO - Memory 1 (use mapping/directions tools) — YES. This task is exactly a routing question; I should use the map site's directions tool to get an estimated driving time and account for any assumptions (departure time / live traffic).
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It tells me to use the mapping/directions tool to get travel time estimates for driving — exactly what we need.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use mapping/directions tools to compute multimodal travel times): I will use this — the page is already an OSRM directions result which gives driving time. It’s exactly the kind of mapping output Memory 1 recommends using. I may note the assumption about realtime traffic not being accounted for.
