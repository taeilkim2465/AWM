## Intent

Preview the Magento Luma theme for my shop

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the Luma storefront (the page screenshot shows the Luma "Jackets" storefront) and asked the user whether they want a storefront preview or the Admin preview, offering next steps and requesting admin credentials if needed. Because it reached a storefront preview and appropriately clarified the user's intent before doing any Admin actions, the execution succeeded.
Status: "success"
