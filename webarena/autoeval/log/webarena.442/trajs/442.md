## Intent

Update the project site's title to "Welcome to my site"

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the project name field was cleared and filled with "Welcome to my site", and subsequent clicks indicate saving. The final page snapshot displays "Welcome to my site" in the project header (top-left) and in the Project name input on the General Settings page, confirming the change was applied and saved.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it directly describes editing project metadata via the Settings page, which is the most likely way to change the project's displayed title. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because those are about finding merge requests, which are not relevant to updating the project title.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Edit project metadata through the Settings page): I will use this memory — it directly matches the task of updating the project name via the project's Settings page, which is already open.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Edit project metadata through the Settings page): I will use this — it's directly relevant because it describes exactly how to change the project name via the Settings page, which matches what we did.
