## Intent

Jakub Klinkovský wants to check my dotfile configurations. Please invite him to the repo as a guest.

## RM

Thoughts: The modal shows "Jakub Klinkovský" added in the Username field and the role "Guest" selected, but the "Invite" button appears disabled and there is no action in the history that clicks a working "Invite" button to submit the invitation. The action history ends without a successful submit (no click on the invite button or confirmation), so the user was not actually invited to the repo.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will open the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" repository to invite Jakub Klinkovský.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (Check members before inviting) so I don't create a duplicate invite — I should open the project's members view first. I will also keep Memory 1 (Verify invite completion) in mind for later (after sending an invite I'll confirm it appears in pending invites). I will not use Memory 3 right now (it's about repo creation details).
===============INFO - Memory 2 (Check members before inviting) is relevant — I should open the Members page first to see if Jakub is already a member to avoid duplicate invites. I will use it.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 for this step.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Verify invite completion and check pending invites" — I will use this. After sending the invite I will look for a success confirmation and check the members/pending-invites list to ensure the invite was created.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify invite completion and check pending invites): I will use this — after sending the invite I must check for confirmation and the pending-invites / members list to confirm the invite was created.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify invite completion and check pending invites): I will use this — after sending the invite I must confirm a success message or check the members/pending-invites list.
