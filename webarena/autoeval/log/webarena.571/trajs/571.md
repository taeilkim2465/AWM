## Intent

I recently moved, my address is 231 Willow Way, Suite 100, Chicago, IL, 60601, update my information on OneStopShopping accordingly

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to update their address to 231 Willow Way, Suite 100, Chicago, IL 60601 (a content modification task). The agent's actions show only navigation and a clarifying question asking whether to update billing, shipping, or both. The page snapshot still displays the old addresses (101 S San Mateo Dr...), and no new address entry or changes are present. Because no address was actually updated, the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Do you want me to update your Default Billing Address, Default Shipping Address, or both to: 231 Willow Way, Suite 100, Chicago, IL 60601?"

===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (it's about going to a dedicated list page for "view my items", not relevant for editing addresses).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open dedicated list page) — Not relevant: we're already on the Address Book page showing address entries, so no need to navigate to a different list.
