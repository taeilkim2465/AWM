## Intent

set the homepage URL on my GitLab profile to https://egg.tart.com

## RM

Thoughts: The agent did update the profile (page shows "Profile was successfully updated"), but the action history shows it set the Website URL to "https://egg.tart.com# Reasoning Memories" (then URL-encoded as ...#%20Reasoning%20Memories) rather than the requested "https://egg.tart.com". Because the homepage was changed to the wrong value (extra fragment/text), the user's intent was not satisfied.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'Done — I updated your GitLab profile Website URL to "https://egg.tart.com# Reasoning Memories". The page shows "Profile was successfully updated". Note: GitLab displays the space as %20 in the field (https://egg.tart.com#%20Reasoning%20Memories

===============INFO - I will not use any of the three memory items because they relate to routing/profile selection for mapping directions and are irrelevant to changing a GitLab profile homepage URL.
===============INFO - I will not use any of the provided memories because they all concern selecting routing profiles for mapping/routing tasks, which are unrelated to editing a GitLab profile page or changing the homepage URL.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it's about routing profiles for directions, not needed for editing a GitLab profile.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Explicitly set and verify the routing profile per leg" — Not relevant to this task (GitLab profile edit). I will not use it.
