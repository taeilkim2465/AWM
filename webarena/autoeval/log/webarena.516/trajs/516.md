## Intent

Add this product to my wishlist

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a green confirmation message saying "Elmwood Inn Fine Teas, Orange Vanilla Caffeine-free Fruit Infusion, 16-Ounce Pouch has been added to your Wish List," and the My Wish List page is displayed with 10 items, so the click successfully added the product to the wishlist.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the memories because they recommend adding items from the product detail page and following the sequence search → open item → add to wishlist; I'm already on the product detail page for this item and I can see the "Add to Wish List" control.
