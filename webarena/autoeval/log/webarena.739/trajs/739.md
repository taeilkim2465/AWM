## Intent

Show me the way from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of Yankees in the 80th

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the origin (Carnegie Mellon University) and destination (Yankee Stadium / E 161st St) and clicked Go. The final page shows a route on the map plus detailed directions (distance 637 km, time 7:25 and step-by-step turns), which satisfies the user's request to show the way. Therefore the navigation task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (procedure for award-winner maps): Not relevant to this task (directions), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - I'll not use Memory 1 (award-winner procedure) — it's unrelated to map directions. I'll not use Memory 3 (navigation badges) — there are no account badges relevant here. Memory 2 (targeted in-page searches) isn't needed because the directions form fields are visible.
