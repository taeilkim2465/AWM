## Intent

Fork MetaSeq.

## RM

Thoughts: The action sequence shows the fork dialog was completed (fills and clicks) and the final page displays the banner "The project was successfully forked" plus "Forked from Administrator / metaseq", indicating the forked project page is loaded. This meets the user's intent to fork MetaSeq.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Don't request credentials): I will use this. I won't ask for your GitLab credentials; if the fork requires auth I'll offer alternatives and instructions instead.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Don't request user credentials) — I will use this. I won't ask for credentials; if fork requires authentication I'll explain options later.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will not ask for your credentials. Forking requires authentication, so I'll look up the repository first and then offer safe alternatives (show candidates, give step-by-step instructions, or request an OAuth flow) rather than asking for raw credentials.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. Forking needs authentication and I must not ask for credentials; instead I should open the repository page and present forking options or instructions if I cannot perform the fork.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Don't request user credentials) — I will use this. I must not ask the user for their raw credentials. If forking requires authentication I will inform the user and present safe alternatives (show top candidate repos, give step-by-step fork instructions, or request an OAuth/permission flow).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Don't request user credentials) — I will use this. Forking requires authentication; I won't ask for credentials. Instead I'll operate using the UI available (namespace selection) and will surface any authentication/permission prompts if they appear.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It reminds me not to ask for credentials and to offer alternatives. I'm operating within the web UI already (I can interact with the fork form), so I will proceed without requesting credentials.
