## Intent

I am doing a market survey for one stop market, show me the most expensive product from PS4 accessories category

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched "PS4 accessories", sorted by Price, and opened the top result. The final page shows the product "ASTRO Gaming A50 Wireless Headset + Base Station Gen 4 - Compatible With PS5, PS4, PC, Mac - Black/Silver" priced at $253.99, which matches the user's request for the most expensive PS4 accessories item. The required information (product name and price) is visible on the page, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (use the site's search box) because searching "PS4 accessories" is the fastest way to surface that category's products and prices. I will not use Memory 1 (food-category filtering) because it's irrelevant to PS4 accessories. I will not use Memory 3 (route results) because it's unrelated.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (category labels/merchant keywords): Not needed — we're already on the PS4 accessories search results page and don't need to filter by food categories.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (category/merchant keywords to isolate food spending): I will not use this — it's about food transactions and not relevant to finding PS4 accessories.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — the memory about using category labels is relevant: I should filter the current results to the PlayStation 4 category to restrict to PS4 accessories.
===============INFO - Memory check:
