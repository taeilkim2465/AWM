## Intent

How many commits did Eric and Kilian make on 1/3/2023 in total?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task (number of commits by two users on a specific date). The agent only asked a clarification question about the date format and took no further actions to check commits or open commit details. The final page snapshot does not show per-user, per-date commit counts. Because the agent did not retrieve or report the requested counts (nor stated they were unavailable), the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Do you mean January 3, 2023 (MM/DD/YYYY

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: I'll use this. I should confirm which date format you mean (1/3/2023 could be Jan 3 or Mar 1) before counting commits.
