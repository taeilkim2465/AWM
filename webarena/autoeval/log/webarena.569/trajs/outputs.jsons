{"id": 569, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This is a content-modification task (invite collaborators). The action history shows the agent opened Members, began filling a name (\"Benoit\") and then stopped to ask clarifying questions about exact usernames and desired access level. The final page snapshot still shows only the existing project member (Byte Blaze) and no pending invites or new collaborators. The agent did not click an \"Invite members\" or confirm/send the invitations, so the requested collaborators were not added or invited. Therefore the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
