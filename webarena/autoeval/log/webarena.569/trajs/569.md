## Intent

Invite Benoît and Abishek as collaborator to my HTML5 markup extention repo

## RM

Thoughts: This is a content-modification task (invite collaborators). The action history shows the agent opened Members, began filling a name ("Benoit") and then stopped to ask clarifying questions about exact usernames and desired access level. The final page snapshot still shows only the existing project member (Byte Blaze) and no pending invites or new collaborators. The agent did not click an "Invite members" or confirm/send the invitations, so the requested collaborators were not added or invited. Therefore the task was not completed.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to check current collaborators and pending invites before sending invites, which I'll follow after opening the repo.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they remind me to check existing collaborators and pending invites before sending new invitations — that avoids duplicate invites.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it instructs to check current collaborators and pending invites before sending invites to avoid duplicates. I'll follow that by opening the members view first.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items because they remind me to check existing collaborators and pending invites before sending new invitations, and to exclude the requester when listing collaborators:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they advise checking the repository's Members page (and pending invites) before sending new invites to avoid duplicates — that's necessary here.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current collaborators and pending invites): I will use this — it advises confirming active collaborators and pending invites before sending invites to avoid duplicates.
===============INFO - I will first check the memory notes about verifying existing collaborators before sending invites to avoid duplicates. I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to check current members and pending invites. Memory 3 (exclude requester when listing collaborators) is not needed for this step.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to check current collaborators and pending invites before inviting to avoid duplicate invites. I'll follow this.
