## Intent

List the last names of the top 3 contributors to 2019-nCov repo, ranked by the number of commits?

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot clearly shows the top two contributors as Louis Lo (286 commits) and Stimim Chen (50 commits), but the third contributor's name and commit count are not visible in the provided page snapshot. The agent returned "Lo, Chen, Chu" without visible evidence for the third-place "Chu" (and did not state that the third was unavailable), so the response cannot be verified from the page and does not meet the information-seeking requirement.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'Top 3 contributors by commits — last names only (ranked

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Report the contributor identity exactly as shown with the commit count" — I will NOT use this. The user only asked for last names of the top 3 contributors, not the exact display names plus commit counts.
===============INFO - Memory 1 asks to report contributor names with commit counts exactly as shown — not needed here because the user only requested last names of the top 3 contributors. I will NOT use Memory 1.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Report the contributor identity exactly as shown with the commit count" — I will not strictly follow this memory now because the user only asked for last names of the top 3 contributors. I may still verify the exact names on the contributors page, but I won't be forced to include commit counts in the final answer unless needed.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (sort by commit count) because the user asked for the "top" contributors and we must rank by number of commits. I will NOT use Memory 1 or Memory 3 because the user only requested last names (not the exact display names, commit counts, or identifiers).
===============INFO - Memory 1: I'll use this later when reporting contributors so I can present names/handles exactly as listed together with commit counts. (USE)
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Report the contributor identity exactly as shown with the commit count" — I will NOT use this memory because the user specifically asked only for the last names of the top 3 contributors, not the full display names or commit counts.
===============INFO - I need to navigate to the commits/contributors view to find the top contributors. I will not extract or report contributor names yet — this step should only open the commits page (or commits/graphs) so I can find the Contributors view.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 ("report contributor identity exactly as shown with the commit count"): not needed — the user only asked for last names, so I won't enforce reporting full names and exact commit counts.
