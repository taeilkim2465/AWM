## Intent

Tell me who has made the most contributions, in terms of number of commits, to the primer/design project

Thoughts: The screenshot of the Contributors page clearly shows "Shawn Allen — 95 commits (shawn.allen@github.com)" as the top entry (next is Inayaili León with 77). The agent's message exactly matches this information, so it correctly retrieved and reported the top contributor and commit count. 
Status: "success"
