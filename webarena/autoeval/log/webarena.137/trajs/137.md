## Intent

What is the estimated driving time between the city where the Liberty Bell is located and the home city of Pirates?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent interpreted the Liberty Bell as Philadelphia and the Pirates as Pittsburgh, filled origin/destination, and generated directions. The final page snapshot clearly shows "Distance: 488km. Time: 5:46.", which matches the agent's reply of about 5 hours 46 minutes. The agent provided the requested estimated driving time, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Interpreting the Liberty Bell as Philadelphia and the Pirates as Pittsburgh, the map shows an estimated driving time of about 5 hours 46 minutes (distance ~488 km
