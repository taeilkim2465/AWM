## Intent

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the issue was created with the correct title and body including quick-action commands. The final page snapshot confirms: title "Integrating LLMs for better prompts", assignee set to Roshanjossey (activity shows assigned to @Roshanjossey), and Due date displayed as Apr 1, 2033. (The assistant's message contains a typo mentioning 2023, but the page state matches the requested Apr 1, 2033.) All requested changes were applied.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Done — I created the issue \"Integrating LLMs for better prompts\" in the empathy-prompts project (Issue #19

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (quick-action commands in the issue description) because it lets me set assignee and due date immediately when creating the issue — that is the fastest and most reliable approach for this task.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (quick-action commands) because adding assignee and due date via quick-actions in the issue description is the fastest way to set both metadata at creation time. I will not use Memory 2 (milestone creation guidance) because the user didn't ask to create a milestone. I will not use Memory 3 (assign from issue details page) because Memory 1 lets me set the assignee immediately when creating the issue, which is faster.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1: yes — I'll include quick-action commands in the issue description so the assignee and due date are applied at creation (faster and reliable).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (quick-action commands): I will use this. Quick-action commands in the description can set assignee and due date at creation, which is faster and avoids potential UI picker flakiness.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use quick-action commands during issue creation to set metadata" — I will use this memory as it is relevant: the issue was created with quick-actions in the description to set assignee and due date, which is faster and was successful (activity shows the assignee and due date were applied).
