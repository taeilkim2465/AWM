## Intent

What is the zip code of Chatham University?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The OpenStreetMap search result in the final snapshot explicitly shows "15208" for Chatham University (Fifth Avenue, Larimer, Pittsburgh), and the agent's message correctly reports that ZIP code and offers to verify it. The required information was provided, so the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "OpenStreetMap shows Chatham University (Fifth Avenue, Larimer, Pittsburgh

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (targeted query phrasing) because phrasing the search to explicitly request a ZIP/postal code should return a direct result. I will use Memory 2 (map search) because the OpenStreetMap page is open and a place search there can quickly find the university and its ZIP. I will keep Memory 3 (prefer authoritative sources) in mind to verify the ZIP after the map result (e.g., by following a link to the university's official contact page), but first I'll perform the map search.
===============INFO - Reviewing the memories:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (targeted query phrasing): Use — I did a targeted search phrase (Chatham University Pittsburgh PA) which helped get a direct result showing a postal code.
