## Intent

Open my latest updated issue that has keyword "homepage content" in its title to check if it is closed

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to open their most recently updated issue with "homepage content" in the title and check if it is closed. The action history shows several search attempts (including 'in:title homepage content'), but the final page snapshot shows the "Open" issues list with unrelated issue titles and no search query or an opened issue visible. The agent did not open an issue or switch to the Closed tab to verify closed status, so it never confirmed whether the target issue is closed.
Status: "failure"
