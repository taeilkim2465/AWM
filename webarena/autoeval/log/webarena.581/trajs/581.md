## Intent

Create a new forum named cmu_lti, with a description of Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, and include ['announcement', 'paper', 'alumni'] in the sidebar?

## RM

Thoughts: The forum "/f/cmu_lti" was created (title shows CMU LTI) and the sidebar contains the three items (announcement, paper, alumni) as requested. However the requested descriptive text "Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University" does not appear anywhere on the page snapshot (only "Created 0 seconds ago" is visible). Because the description requested by the user is not present in the final state, the task is not fully completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because when creating a forum I should fill both the visible name and the internal/slug identifier to avoid mismatches. Memories 2 and 3 are about searching/places and not relevant for this task, so I will not use them.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to fill both the visible name and the internal/slug identifier when creating a forum — that will be important once I reach the forum creation form. Memories 2 and 3 are about searching for institutions and are not relevant for this task, so I will not use them.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Fill both identifier fields when creating a forum): I will use this — when the create-forum form appears I should fill both the visible name and the internal/slug identifier to keep naming consistent.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (Fill both identifier fields) to ensure both the internal slug and the visible title are set consistently. Memories 2 and 3 (about institution/place autocomplete) are not relevant to this form, so I will not use them.
