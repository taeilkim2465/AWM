## Intent

What is the duration required to first walk from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street, and then drive to Pittsburgh International Airport?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the duration to first walk from Carnegie Mellon University to the Starbucks on Craig Street and then drive from that Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport. The action history shows multiple attempts toggling between Foot and Car routes, but the final page snapshot and left directions panel only show the driving route from Starbucks to the airport (Distance 32 km, Time 0:31). There is no visible walking leg from CMU to the Starbucks nor any summed total time. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to present both leg durations (or state the walking duration is unavailable); it did not.  
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because the user specifically asked for walking time for the first leg — I should use a pedestrian/walking routing profile so the walking duration is realistic. I will not use Memory 2 because the user already specified the airport (Pittsburgh International Airport), so I don't need to enumerate nearby airports.
===============INFO - Memory items:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they both instruct to use a pedestrian/walking routing profile when estimating walking time — that's exactly required for the first leg. I will not use Memory 2 because we don't need to search or enumerate airports; the airport destination is already known.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use pedestrian routing profile for walking-duration estimates): I will use this — the walking leg already used Foot (OSRM) to produce a realistic 7-minute walk, so it's relevant to confirm we used a pedestrian profile for the first leg.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use pedestrian routing profile for walking-duration estimates): I will use this — the user asked for walking time for the first leg, and the page already used Foot (OSRM) to compute it. That gives a realistic walking duration.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use pedestrian routing profile for walking-duration estimates): I will use this — the walking segment must be computed with a pedestrian/foot routing profile for realistic walking time.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use pedestrian routing profile for walking-duration estimates): I will use this memory — the current walking route was already computed with the Foot (OSRM) profile and shows the walking time.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use pedestrian routing for walking) — Yes, I'll use this so the walking duration is computed with a foot/pedestrian profile.
