## Intent

Set my gitlab status as Enjoying life.

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent cleared and filled the status field with "Enjoying life." and performed clicks that likely saved and opened the profile menu. The final page snapshot clearly displays the profile dropdown with the status "Enjoying life." and the assistant informed the user the status is set. This meets the user's request to set the GitLab status to "Enjoying life."
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Your GitLab status is already set to: \"Enjoying life.\" Would you like me to change it to something else or clear it?"
