## Intent

Measure distance between Carnegie Mellon University and CVS (closet one) by walking

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task (measure walking distance to the nearest CVS). The agent did not provide the requested measurement to the user — instead it asked a clarifying question. Although the agent's actions set the Foot profile and ran a route, the page snapshot shows a 963 km walking route to a CVS in Rhode Island (not the nearest CVS to Carnegie Mellon), so the result is incorrect or incomplete. Because the agent neither returned the correct distance to the nearest CVS nor explicitly reported that the information was unavailable, the task failed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I can re-find the nearest CVS to Carnegie Mellon University and re-run a walking route (ensuring the Foot profile is used

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the routing/directions feature on OpenStreetMap and ensure the travel mode is set to walking so the route uses pedestrian paths (this matches Memories 1 and 2). I will also rely on route-based distance/time from the routing engine rather than straight-line distance (Memory 3).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (choose walking profile): I will use this — it reminds me to ensure the routing profile is set to walking so the route is pedestrian-appropriate.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Choose the walking routing profile for pedestrian distance" — I will use this. The page already shows "Foot (OSRM)" selected, but I'll keep this in mind and confirm the walking profile before measuring.
