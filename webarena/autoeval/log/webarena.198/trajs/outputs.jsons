{"id": 198, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent replied with a specific cancelled order and customer name, but the action history only shows generic clicks and the final page snapshot displays the Filters panel (no order list or order details visible). There's no evidence the agent actually opened the cancelled order or retrieved the customer name from the page. For an information-seeking task we need the agent's actions and the final state to show the requested data; here they do not, so the claimed result is unsupported.", "status": "failure"}}
