## Intent

Get the customer name of the most recent cancelled order

## RM

Thoughts: The agent replied with a specific cancelled order and customer name, but the action history only shows generic clicks and the final page snapshot displays the Filters panel (no order list or order details visible). There's no evidence the agent actually opened the cancelled order or retrieved the customer name from the page. For an information-seeking task we need the agent's actions and the final state to show the requested data; here they do not, so the claimed result is unsupported. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'The most recent cancelled order is order 000000136 (Purchase Date: May 23, 2023 9:20:01 PM

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it's important to check whether a cancelled order is indeed the most recent relative to non-cancelled orders so I can report the correct "most recent cancelled order" and note any newer active orders if relevant.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 ("Check for newer cancelled orders relative to latest active order"): I will use this. It instructs me to verify whether any cancelled orders are more recent than the latest non-cancelled order so I can explain why a cancelled order is the "most recent" cancelled order.

User Intent: Get the customer name of the most recent cancelled order

Action History:
1: click('156')
2: click('168')
3: click('845')
4: send_msg_to_user('The most recent cancelled order is order 000000136 (Purchase Date: May 23, 2023 9:20:01 PM). The customer name on that cancelled order is Lily Potter. Note: there are newer orders (e.g., 000000299 on May 31 and 000000065 on May 28), but they are not cancelled, so 000000136 is the latest cancelled one.)')
