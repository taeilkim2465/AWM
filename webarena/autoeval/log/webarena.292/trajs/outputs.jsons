The agent replied that there are \"0 records found\" and therefore the top customer's cancellations = 0, but the final page snapshot clearly shows the Orders grid with an active filter \"Status: Canceled\" and \"142 records found\" (and visible canceled orders). The agent did not compute per-customer cancellation counts or identify the customer with the most cancellations, and its conclusion contradicts the page state. Because the required information (the total cancellations for the customer with the most cancellations) was not correctly determined or reported, the execution is unsuccessful.", "status": "failure"}}
