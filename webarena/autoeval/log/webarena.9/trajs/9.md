## Intent

Tell me the full address of all international airports that are within a driving distance of 30 km to Carnegie Art Museum

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for full addresses of all international airports within a 30 km driving distance of Carnegie Art Museum. The agent's actions show searches and navigation on OpenStreetMap (ended on Pittsburgh International Airport), but there is no evidence the agent computed driving distances, identified all qualifying international airports, or returned their full addresses. The final page only shows a map (Pittsburgh Intl) and no address list or statement that no others exist. Because the required information was not provided and the distance criterion was not verified, the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they describe the correct approach for this task:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The task requires "within 30 km driving distance", so I will compute route-based driving distances rather than straight-line distances.
===============INFO - I will use the routing-related memories because the task requires driving-distance (not straight-line) checks:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. The task requires driving-distance (not straight-line) checks; the OpenStreetMap directions widget uses an OSRM routing service which I should use to get the route distance/time.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — this task requires checking "within 30 km driving distance", so I should compute driving distances using a routing/directions service rather than straight-line estimates.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the memories because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories because they directly apply to this task:
