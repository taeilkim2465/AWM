{"id": 9, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for full addresses of all international airports within a 30 km driving distance of Carnegie Art Museum. The agent's actions show searches and navigation on OpenStreetMap (ended on Pittsburgh International Airport), but there is no evidence the agent computed driving distances, identified all qualifying international airports, or returned their full addresses. The final page only shows a map (Pittsburgh Intl) and no address list or statement that no others exist. Because the required information was not provided and the distance criterion was not verified, the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
