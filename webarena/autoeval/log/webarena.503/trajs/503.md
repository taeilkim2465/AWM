## Intent

Make all rocco gym tank as out of stock

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for "Rocco Gym Tank" and opened the Actions menu, but the final page shows each Rocco Gym Tank with Quantity 100 and Salable Quantity 100 and Status "Enabled" — there is no indication the products were set to Out of Stock. The action sequence appears to have opened/change menus (e.g. "Change status") rather than updating stock availability or setting quantity to 0. Because the product stock values were not changed to out of stock, the task was not completed.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows before taking action:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ensure complete visibility of all items for the date): I will use this — it's important to watch for pagination, filters, or "load more" so I don't miss any "Rocco Gym Tank" items when marking them out of stock.
===============INFO - We need to find all "Rocco Gym Tank" products in the Products grid so we can mark them out of stock. Right now the grid is filtered for "Gobi HeatTec", so first I should search for "Rocco Gym Tank".
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will ensure all relevant items are visible before making changes. The product grid shows "6 records found" and "per page 200", so pagination is not hiding items. I'll still be careful to check the variant records individually.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ensure complete visibility of all items): I will use this memory. When I finish updating this product I will need to return to the product list and ensure all "Rocco Gym Tank" products are visible (check for filters, pagination, or "load more") so none are missed.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. I will ensure the page is fully visible and not paginated before saving so the change applies correctly.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ensure complete visibility of all items): USE. I should return to the product grid and run the product name filter so I can see all "Rocco Gym Tank" items (checking pagination or "load more" later if needed).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. It reminds me to ensure all items are visible; the page shows "6 records found" and per-page is 200, so all variants are loaded. Good.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows before taking action:
