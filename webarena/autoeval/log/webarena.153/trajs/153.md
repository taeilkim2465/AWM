## Intent

What is the minimum travel time by car from REI to CMU?

## RM

Thoughts: The Directions panel in the final webpage snapshot clearly shows "Distance: 593km. Time: 7:19." The agent filled origin/destination, selected Car (OSRM), ran directions, and reported the same estimated driving time and distance. This satisfies the information-seeking request for minimum travel time by car (OSRM's route/time shown).  
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'The estimated driving time from REI to Carnegie Mellon University is about 7 hours 19 minutes (distance ≈ 593 km

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use mapping/directions tools for routing/time queries — I will use this (yes). The OpenStreetMap "Find directions between two points" tool is the appropriate directions interface to get driving time estimates.
===============INFO - I will use the mapping/directions memories because they directly apply to this routing question.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use mapping/directions tools — YES. The directions panel on the page (OSRM) is the primary source for the driving-time estimate.
