{"id": 522, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent was to fork all repos from the Facebook org (a content-modification task). The agent only sent a clarifying message asking which org/repos and whether to act or provide scripts; no fork actions were taken. The final webpage snapshot shows the agent's GitLab projects list (not a list of forked Facebook repos), so there is no evidence the forking was performed. Therefore the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
