What do customers say about brush from sephora

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent navigated to the Sephora product page and opened the Reviews tab; the snapshot shows the review submission form and the "Be the first to review this product" state, so there are no customer reviews on Sephora for this brush. The agent explicitly reported that and offered sensible next steps, so it fulfilled the user's request (stating that reviews are not available) and asked how to proceed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I checked the product page: there are no customer reviews for this specific brush (the page shows the review form and a “Be the first to review this product” link
