## Intent

Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got more than 100 stars?

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot shows the "Personal projects" tab with repositories and their star counts (0, 0, 2, 6) — none exceed 100 stars. The user's request asked for repositories where they made contributions (which could include "Contributed projects"), but the agent only inspected the Personal projects tab and did not check the Contributed projects section. Because the agent did not examine the contributed projects list, it cannot reliably report all repositories the user contributed to that have >100 stars. Therefore the execution is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (pagination/total items): I will use this — the "Yours 14" indicator suggests there are 14 projects total, so the list is bounded and likely not paginated; I should scroll through the full list to check each repo's star count and my role (Owner/Maintainer/Developer) to determine where I contributed and whether stars > 100.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — check for pagination/total count is relevant if the list is long and I need to scan beyond the visible items to find repos with >100 stars.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (pagination/header) — I will use this: if the project list is paginated I may need to jump pages to find all repos with >100 stars, so I'll check the sorted list and the header if needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the listing header to detect pagination and total items): Not needed — we're trying to find projects I contributed to across my profile, not paginate the current project list.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the listing header to detect pagination and total items): I will use this — it reminds me to check whether the view is paginated and whether I’m seeing the highest-starred projects. The page shows "Yours 14" (14 personal projects) and the list is sorted by "Most stars", so the top items are visible here and there isn't an obvious pagination header indicating more pages of higher-star repos.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (pagination header): I will not use this — the current task is to find repos I contributed to with >100 stars, not to infer pagination.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use listing header to detect pagination/total items): I will use this — the "Contributed projects" view may be paginated or show totals, which will help find all repos with >100 stars without missing entries.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (pagination header): Not useful — the "Contributed projects" view is empty and pagination isn't relevant right now.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the listing header to detect pagination and total items — I will use this. After opening the "Contributed projects" tab I'll check the listing header to see if the view is paginated so I know whether to navigate pages for older entries.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (pagination header): Not useful — the current page is a profile/projects view, not a long paginated list of items to scan.
