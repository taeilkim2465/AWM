Thoughts: This is a content-modification task (upvoting posts). The agent searched Postmill for "author:CameronKelsey subreddit:earthporn" and the page shows "No results". The agent did not perform any upvotes or navigate to reddit to locate submissions; instead it asked the user whether to search reddit.com directly and how many posts to upvote.

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they advise locating items by keyword and sorting/filtering by creation date — that will help me find the user's submissions (and ensure I can act on the newest ones first if needed).

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created item that matches the keyword): I will NOT use this right now because the current search on this site returned no results, so there is nothing here to open.
