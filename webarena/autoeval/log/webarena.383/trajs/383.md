## Intent

I am arriving at Pittsburgh Airport. Show me the name of a Hyatt hotel if there is any nearby. Tell me the names of supermarkets that are within 15mins driving from the hotel

## RM

Thoughts: This was an information-seeking task. The final page snapshot shows the Nominatim search page with a world map and no search results or listings visible. The action history shows repeated searches but no retrieved hotel name or list of supermarkets, and the agent's response did not provide the requested hotel name or supermarkets within a 15-minute drive. Because the required information was neither returned nor explicitly stated unavailable, the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (search using "hotel brand + airport name") to find Hyatt properties near Pittsburgh Airport quickly. I will also plan to use Memory 1 (confirm the hotel's exact identity and location before using it as an origin) after the search results appear. Memory 2 (use the located hotel as the origin for nearby-amenity searches) will be used once I confirm the hotel's entry.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm hotel's exact identity and location): I will use this — I need to confirm the exact hotel entry before searching for nearby supermarkets so the results are accurate.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm the hotel's exact identity and location before using it as an origin" — I will use this. The map already shows "Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport", so I should confirm by using that hotel name as the origin for nearby searches.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories:
===============INFO - Memory check:
