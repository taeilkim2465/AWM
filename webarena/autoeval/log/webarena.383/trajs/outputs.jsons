However it did not provide the requested list of supermarkets within a 15-minute drive. The OpenStreetMap search returned \"No results found\" and the agent instead asked whether to search Google Maps or another service rather than telling the user the supermarket names or explicitly stating none are available. Because the user requested supermarket names and the agent did not fulfill that part, the task is not complete.", "status": "failure"}}

The action history shows repeated searches but no retrieved hotel name or list of supermarkets, and the agent's response did not provide the requested hotel name or supermarkets within a 15-minute drive.
