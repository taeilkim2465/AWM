## Intent

Delete all negative reviews for Sybil running short

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to delete all negative reviews for "Sybil Running Short." The agent's action history shows only searches/inspections (clicks and fill) and a message stating 3 reviews (IDs 303, 302, 301) are present and appear positive; the agent explicitly noted it did not delete anything and asked whether to inspect or delete. The final page snapshot shows the three reviews still listed. No delete action (no bulk delete or individual delete clicks) was performed. Therefore the requested deletion was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I checked the Reviews table: 3 reviews for "Sybil Running Short" are present (IDs 303, 302, 301

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify each candidate with full review details and multiple metadata fields before deletion): I will use this. It's important to open each review and confirm content, author, timestamp, and linked account info before deleting to avoid mistakes.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will verify each candidate by opening the full review record and checking content, author, timestamp and metadata before deleting.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It says to verify each candidate with full review details and metadata before deletion — I should not delete from the list view or based on a single field. On this page I can see full review content (5-star, positive text), so I will not delete it.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (verify each candidate) because it instructs to open and confirm full review content and metadata before deleting — that's necessary here. I will use Memory 2 (traverse paginated results) as a precaution, although the current filter shows "3 records found" and pagination indicates a single page; I should still ensure all pages are checked if needed. I will not use Memory 3 (populate review fields) because it is about submitting reviews, not relevant to deletion/verification.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I will verify each review fully before deleting to avoid false positives (open full review, check author, timestamp, content).
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify each candidate with full review details): I will use this — I must open and confirm each review's full content/metadata before deleting to avoid removing false positives.
===============INFO - I will consult the memories before acting.
