## Intent

List all opened issues requesting new features

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for all open issues requesting new features (i.e. all open issues labeled "enhancement"). The agent applied the label:enhancement filter and returned a list, but explicitly limited it to the "current filtered view" (one page) and offered to go to the next page or export the full filtered list. Because there are many open issues (95) spanning multiple pages, the agent did not actually provide "all" enhancement issues and did not state the full list was unavailable — it only provided the current page. For an information-seeking task asking for all items, this partial result is insufficient. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Here are the open issues requesting new features (label: enhancement

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I'll explicitly set the issue state to "open" when I reach the Issues list so results are correct.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Explicitly set issue state): Use. The user asked for opened issues, so I should ensure the "Open" filter is applied. The AXTree shows the "Open 95" tab is already selected, so no extra click is needed but I will note that I'm explicitly relying on that state.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Explicitly set issue state): Use it — I should explicitly make sure the "Open" tab is active to avoid ambiguity, even though it appears selected.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (explicitly set issue state) because the user asked for opened issues — I confirm the Open tab is selected and the filter is applied, so that requirement is satisfied.
