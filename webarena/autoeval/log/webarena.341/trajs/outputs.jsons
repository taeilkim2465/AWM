The agent applied the label:enhancement filter and returned a list, but explicitly limited it to the \"current filtered view\" (one page) and offered to go to the next page or export the full filtered list. Because there are many open issues (95) spanning multiple pages, the agent did not actually provide \"all\" enhancement issues and did not state the full list was unavailable \u2014 it only provided the current page. For an information-seeking task asking for all items, this partial result is insufficient.", "status": "failure"}}
