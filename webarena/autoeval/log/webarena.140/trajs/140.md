## Intent

What is the estimated driving time between the city of Niagara Falls and the city of Yale University?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled origin and destination, requested driving directions from OSRM, and the final page shows "Distance: 689km. Time: 8:50." The agent's message to the user correctly reports the estimated driving time (about 8h 50m), distance, and source, satisfying the information-seeking intent.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Estimated driving time (by car

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (populate origin/destination) and Memory 3 (set driving mode/time) because they directly guide how to get an estimated driving time between two cities. I will not use Memory 2 (team/landmark mapping) because the query is about a university name, not a sports team.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (Populate map origin/destination) because it directly instructs filling the map's origin/destination fields to get travel estimates — that's exactly what's needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. The directions on the page were generated after filling the origin/destination with the resolved city names, so this memory directly matches what we did and confirms the route results are valid.
