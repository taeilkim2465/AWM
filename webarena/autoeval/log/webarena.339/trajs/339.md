## Intent

List all opened issues that report bugs

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the filters (label:bug and is:open) and the Issues page shows the Open tab with 3 results, each tagged "bug". The visible open bug issues are: #1478 "[Bug] 404s, bad host, timeouts, bad urls for URLs linked from website"; #1419 "Investigate if <details>/<summary> is a good choice for our Checklist"; and #1408 "In error state, focused controls take on purple or red-and-purple focus indicator". This matches the user's request to list all opened issues reporting bugs.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the repository's Issues list as the canonical place for label-based views — I will use this (relevant).
===============INFO - I will use the repository Issues list and its label filters to find issues labeled "bug" (Memory 1 and Memory 2 are applicable). The user asked for opened issues, and by default the Issues view is showing Open issues, so I'll assume open-only as the default (Memory 3 is applicable).
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they recommend using the repository's Issues list view and its label filters to find label-based issue lists — that's exactly what we need. I will not use Memory 3 because the user explicitly asked for opened issues (so I don't need to assume defaults).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the repository's Issues list as the canonical place for label-based views — I will use this. We're already on the Issues list view, so this memory is relevant.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they recommend using the repository's Issues list and its built-in label filters — that's exactly the current view and filter (label:bug is:open). I will also use Memory 3: the user asked for "opened issues" so defaulting to open issues is correct.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the repository's Issues list as canonical place for label-based views — I will use this (we are already on the Issues list).
===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
