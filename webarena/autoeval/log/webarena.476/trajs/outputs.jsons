{"id": 476, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked to set up a new, empty repository named \"awesome_llm_reading\". The agent only clicked to open the \"Create new project\" page and then asked the user to confirm options (README, license, visibility, etc.). There is no action that actually created the project (no form filled/submitted or \"Create project\" clicked), and the final page still shows the project creation options. Therefore the repository was not created and the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
