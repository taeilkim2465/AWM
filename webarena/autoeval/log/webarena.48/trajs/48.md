## Intent

Today is 6/12/2023. Tell me how many fulfilled orders I have over the past three days, and the total amount of money I spent.

## RM

Thoughts: The My Orders page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total" and the newest order date visible is 5/17/23 (no entries dated 6/9–6/11). Therefore there are 0 fulfilled orders and $0.00 spent in the past three days; the agent also offered to scan other pages if the user wants further confirmation. 
Status: "success"

The page shows the account sidebar and a "My Orders" link, but I don't see a badge/count next to it in the current view, so the badge-check memories tell me to open the full orders list.
