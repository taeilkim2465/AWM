## Intent

Notify Sarah Miller in their most recent pending order with message "the order is ready to be shipped soon!"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent attempted to filter by "Pending" and search for "Sarah Miller" (actions 4–6, 9–10), but the final Orders page snapshot shows other customers (John Lee, Daniel Jackson) with Status "Complete" and no Sarah Miller entry or any indication that a specific order was opened or a message was sent. The action history contains no clear "send message" or "notify" action on a Sarah Miller order, and the page state provides no confirmation of notification. Therefore the requested notification was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it — I should open the Orders list and then filter to Pending and sort by date (descending) to find the most recent pending order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — this is helpful. I should filter to Pending status and sort by Purchase Date (descending) before selecting Sarah Miller's most recent pending order.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Filter and sort before choosing "most recent pending"): I will use this — it tells me to filter by Status = Pending and sort by Purchase Date descending before choosing an order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it (yes). It suggests filtering to Pending and sorting by date desc. I already have Pending + Sarah Miller active but it returned 0 results, so I'll clear the status filter and instead search all orders for "Sarah Miller" and sort by Purchase Date (descending) to find the most recent order and then look for a row with Status = Pending.
