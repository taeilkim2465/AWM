## Intent

Change my reddit bio to "Freelance Web Developer"

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the biography field and preview containing "Freelance Web Developer", the sidebar profile displays "Freelance Web Developer", and there's a green confirmation toast "The biography was updated." These indicate the bio was successfully changed.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 ("Save changes and verify the update") is relevant — I'll remember to save the bio after editing and then double-check the public profile shows the new text. I will use this memory.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to click the save/submit control and verify the public profile after editing the biography — that will be important later when I finish editing. Memory 2 is not relevant (it's about opening a list page for "view my items"), so I will not use it. Memory 3 (offer next-step options when no matches are found) is also not relevant to changing the bio, so I will not use it.
