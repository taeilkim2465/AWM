{"id": 434, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked the agent to add the lowest per\u2011unit product from their open tabs to the cart. The agent only reported it cannot see other open tabs, computed the per\u2011unit price for the current page (~$4.33 for $12.99/3), and asked the user whether to switch tabs or provide URLs and which color/quantity to choose. The agent did not switch tabs, did not compare prices across tabs, and did not select a color or add any item to the cart. Therefore the requested task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
