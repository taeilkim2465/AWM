The action history only shows navigation/clicks on the product site (review pages) and does not include any action that posts to Reddit. The task required (1) gathering all review titles with 2 stars or less and (2) posting them to the games subreddit under the given title. There is evidence the agent reached the reviews page and saw at least one qualifying title, but no evidence it collected all qualifying titles across pages (there are 2 pages of reviews) or that it posted the collected titles to the games subreddit. Therefore the overall task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
