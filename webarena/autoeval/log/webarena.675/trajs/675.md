## Intent

Gather the titles of HORI 3D Surround Gaming Neckset reviews with 2 stars and less rating from OneStopShop, and post them in the games subreddit under the title "real user feedback on HORI 3D Surround Gaming Neckset"

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot shows the product reviews page and at least one 2‑star review titled "I wish this was better...". The action history only shows navigation/clicks on the product site (review pages) and does not include any action that posts to Reddit. The task required (1) gathering all review titles with 2 stars or less and (2) posting them to the games subreddit under the given title. There is evidence the agent reached the reviews page and saw at least one qualifying title, but no evidence it collected all qualifying titles across pages (there are 2 pages of reviews) or that it posted the collected titles to the games subreddit. Therefore the overall task was not completed. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 because it advises using the site search and review rating filters to locate low-rated reviews and confirm extraction targets — that is directly relevant. I will not use Memory 3 (irrelevant) and I will defer Memory 1 (quoting guidance) until after I collect the review titles (so I won't apply it now).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Embed short verbatim quotes) — I will NOT use this memory now because the user asked only for review titles (not verbatim quotes or formatted attributions).
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 (use site review filters and confirm extraction targets) because it reminds me to filter reviews by rating; this site lacks a rating filter so I'll manually check each review's rating value (the page shows percentages that map to star counts: 100%=5, 80%=4, 60%=3, 40%=2, 20%=1). I will not use Memory 1 right now (embed short verbatim quotes) because the current step is to collect review titles, not format or post them yet. I will not use Memory 3 (repository filtering) since it's unrelated.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Embed short verbatim quotes with clear attribution): I will not use this — the user asked only for review titles, not to embed quotes or add attributions.
===============INFO - Memory check and use:
===============INFO - I'll consider the remembered guidance before proceeding.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 because it reminds me to filter/confirm the rating values and the review title fields before extracting; that's directly relevant to gathering reviews with 2 stars or fewer. I will not use Memory 1 right now (it's about embedding quotes/attribution for presentation — that may be useful later when composing the Reddit post but is not needed for the next scraping action). I will not use Memory 3 (it's about GitHub repos and unrelated).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Embed short verbatim quotes with clear attribution): I will not use this now because the user asked specifically for review titles with 2 stars and less; embedding quotes/attribution isn't requested at this step.
===============INFO - Memory check:
