## Intent

Create a discussion post about "long distance relationship" in a relevant subreddit and ask users for their opinions with the simple prompt, "your opinion"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the Title ("Long distance relationship") and Body ("your opinion") and prepared the submission for the relationship_advice forum, but the final page clearly shows the error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." That means the submission was not posted; the agent stopped and asked the user how to proceed instead of successfully creating the discussion. Therefore the task (creating the post) was not completed. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "The submission form is ready (Title: 'Long distance relationship', Body: 'your opinion', Forum: relationship_advice

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they both recommend keeping discussion posts concise and directly actionable — the user asked for a very short prompt ("your opinion"), so that guidance is relevant. I will not use Memory 3 (it's about geographic queries) because it's irrelevant to composing a discussion post.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they recommend keeping the post body concise and directly actionable — that matches the user's request to use the simple prompt "your opinion", which is already filled in the Body field. I will not use Memory 3 because it is about geographic queries and is not relevant.
