===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide how I find completed orders.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Avoid selecting in-progress orders): I will use this. The user asked for completed orders only, so I must exclude processing/pending statuses when locating orders.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Avoid selecting in-progress orders): I will use this — it's relevant to ensure we only consider orders with a final "Complete" status (the UI already shows Status: Complete active).
