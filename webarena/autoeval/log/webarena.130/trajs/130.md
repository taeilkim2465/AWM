## Intent

What's the total number of items sold in the most recent 5 orders?

## RM

Thoughts: The dashboard screenshot only shows two of the "Last Orders" rows (Sarah Miller: 5 items, Grace Nguyen: 4 items). The agent's reply claims a total of 18 with a breakdown for five orders (5,4,3,4,2), but the page snapshot does not display the other three orders so the total cannot be verified from the final state. The agent also did no additional navigation or evidence capture to justify the claimed sum. Therefore the response is not supported by the provided page state.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'The total number of items sold in the most recent 5 orders is 18. Breakdown: Sarah Miller 5, Grace Nguyen 4, Matt Baker 3, Lily Potter 4, Ava Brown 2.'
