The agent's reply claims a total of 18 with a breakdown for five orders (5,4,3,4,2), but the page snapshot does not display the other three orders so the total cannot be verified from the final state. The agent also did no additional navigation or evidence capture to justify the claimed sum. Therefore the response is not supported by the provided page state.", "status": "failure"}}
