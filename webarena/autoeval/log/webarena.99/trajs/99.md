## Intent

Where is the nearest Five Guys to 5700 Penn Ave, and what is the walking distance to it?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent displayed a walking route to a Five Guys on Freeport Road and reported Distance 7.4 km / Time 1:39, but the user asked for the nearest Five Guys. The agent explicitly offered to search other nearby locations rather than confirming which is nearest. Because it did not determine/confirm the nearest location or state that no nearer locations exist, it did not complete the information-seeking task.
Status: failure

## Final Response "The map currently has a walking route to Five Guys on Freeport Road (Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar
