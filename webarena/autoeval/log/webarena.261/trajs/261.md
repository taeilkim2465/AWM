## Intent

I want to browse the products in the Headphones category

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows "Search results for: 'headphones'" and the left filter "Now Shopping by Category: Headphones" with product thumbnails and "Items 1-12 of 577" — the agent successfully navigated to and displayed the Headphones product listings, fulfilling the browsing request.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the site's search box for a fast, focused start" — I will NOT use this memory right now. Searching could work, but browsing the category menu is more reliable to find the official "Headphones" category and avoid unrelated keyword matches.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the site's search box for a fast, focused start" — I will NOT use this. The page already shows a Category list including a direct "Headphones" link, which is faster and more reliable than a keyword search.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the site's search box): I will NOT use this — the page already shows the Headphones category, so searching isn't needed right now.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use search box) — I will not use this. The page already shows the Headphones category and subcategory links, so using the search box would be redundant.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the site's search box for a fast, focused start" — I will NOT use this now because the page already shows search results for "headphones" (the search was performed and results are visible).
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the site's search box for a fast, focused start."
