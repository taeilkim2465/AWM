## Intent

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not useful — it's about unit price calculations for commerce listings, which is unrelated to making a Reddit post.

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1-3 are about commerce listings or filtering repos I contributed to; they are not relevant to selecting a forum or filling the submission body here, so I will not use any memory items.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (price-per-unit): Not relevant to this task — I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (pricing) is irrelevant — I will not use it.
