## Intent

Tell me the the number of reviews that our store received by far that mention term "not useful"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the "not useful" filter in the Review column (visible in the filter input), ran the search, and the grid shows "0 records found" with the message "We couldn't find any records." Pagination reads "1 of 1" and arrows are disabled, so there are no additional pages to check. The agent's report that 0 reviews mention "not useful" is supported by the page state.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'I found 0 reviews that mention "not useful". The Reviews grid shows 0 records found and the message "We could not find any records." Pagination is 1 of 1, so all pages were checked.'

===============INFO - Memory 1 (traverse pagination): Use — this is relevant as a principle, but instead of manually scanning pages I will apply the Reviews filter so the system returns all matching records at once (this still satisfies the completeness requirement).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (traverse pagination): I will use this — if the search returns results I must check all pages before reporting the final count.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this — the page shows "1 of 1" pages and "0 records found", so there's no additional pages to check.
