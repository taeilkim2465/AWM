## Intent

Upvote the newest post in DIY subreddit

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the DIY subreddit and sorted by New. In the final page the top (newest) post's upvote arrow is highlighted (orange), and the header shows a logged-in account — this indicates the agent successfully upvoted the newest post.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will not use this. The user only asked to upvote the newest DIY post, so locking a top-10 set is unnecessary.
===============INFO - I'll consider the listed memories before acting.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to lock the top-N posts once I'm on the DIY subreddit page so I don't inspect the wrong items. Memory 2 (interpreting condensed vote displays) isn't necessary right now — we only need to find and upvote the newest post. Memory 3 (extracting organization mentions) is irrelevant.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (locking a top-10 set) because the task is to upvote the newest post only, not to inspect a top-N list. I will not use Memory 2 (interpret vote displays) because we only need to upvote, not interpret scores. I will not use Memory 3 (extract organization mentions) because it's irrelevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm and limit to the top-N post set..." — I will NOT use this. The user asked to upvote the newest post (just the top item after sorting by New), so locking a top-10 set is unnecessary and would add extra steps.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 — the task is to upvote the single newest post, so I don't need to lock a top-N set.
