## Intent

List products from PS4 accessories category by ascending price

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows "Now Shopping by Category: PlayStation 4" and "Accessories (228)" and the Sort By control has "Price" selected with an upward arrow (indicating ascending). The agent applied the PS4 accessories filter and sorted by price ascending, so the products are displayed in the requested order. Therefore the task is completed (note: the agent actions produced the correct page view showing products sorted ascending by price). 
Status: "success"
