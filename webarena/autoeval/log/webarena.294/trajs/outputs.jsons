The agent replied with the correct SSH clone template (git clone git@<host>:<namespace>/ChatGPT.git), gave concrete examples (git@gitlab.com:your-username/ChatGPT.git and git@example.com:your-group/ChatGPT.git), and explained how to copy the exact SSH URL from the GitLab UI. That satisfies the information-seeking intent even though the exact repo SSH URL on this instance wasn't available from the page snapshot.", "status": "success"}}
