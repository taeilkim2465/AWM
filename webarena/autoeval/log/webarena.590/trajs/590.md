## Intent

Create a milestone for the upcoming event of product launch starting on 1/16/2023 and ending on 1/30/2023

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent filled title "Product launch" and start/due dates 2023-01-16 to 2023-01-30 and clicked to create. The page snapshot displays the "Product launch" milestone with Start date Jan 16, 2023 and Due date Jan 30, 2023 (marked Past due), confirming the milestone was created with the requested dates. Although the milestone is now shown as past due, the user's specified dates were correctly applied and the creation succeeded.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Convert vague time ranges into explicit inclusive date boundaries): USE — It reminds me to ensure the milestone dates are explicit and inclusive. The user already gave exact dates (1/16/2023 to 1/30/2023), so I'll treat start = 2023-01-16 and end = 2023-01-30 inclusive when creating the milestone.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1: Yes — it reminds me to translate the requested range into explicit inclusive dates. I'll set the milestone start = 2023-01-16 and due = 2023-01-30.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Convert vague time ranges into explicit inclusive date boundaries): I will use this — the user gave specific dates (1/16/2023 to 1/30/2023) and Memory 1 reminds me to treat them as explicit inclusive boundaries when setting start and due dates in the form.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Convert vague time ranges...) — USE. It is directly relevant: I should confirm I converted the requested range into explicit start/end dates (Jan 16, 2023 — Jan 30, 2023) before creating the milestone.
