## Intent

Today is 3/15/2023, generate a sales order report for last year

## RM

Thoughts: The agent selected the year/date range (01/01/2022–12/31/2022), ran the Orders Report, and the final page snapshot shows the report table with totals that match the agent's summary (Orders 116, Sales Items 349, Sales Total $15,475.46, etc.). The agent also noted the export format (CSV) and offered sensible next steps. The user’s intent (generate last year's sales order report) was satisfied and the required information was provided.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I generated the Orders Report for last year (Jan 1–Dec 31, 2022

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories to guide how I generate the report:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to set the From/To dates to the full calendar year and choose the matching aggregation (Yearly) so the report covers exactly last year (2022).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Set an explicit year date range and matching aggregation): I will use this — it tells me to set From/To to the full calendar year and choose the matching period (Yearly) so the report aggregates correctly for last year (2022).
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Set an explicit year date range and matching aggregation" — I will use this. I already set Period = Year and From/To = 1/1/22–12/31/22 so the report aggregates the full 2022 calendar year correctly.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. It says to set the From/To to the full calendar year and pick matching aggregation; the report on screen is already Yearly with From 1/1/22 To 12/31/22, which matches "last year" for 3/15/2023.
