## Intent

Edit my post on Lord of the Rings by adding a line to the body that says "The cast is amazing!"

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent filled the post body with "The cast is amazing!" and submitted the edit. The page snapshot displays that exact line under the post title and a green confirmation banner "The submission was edited." These confirm the requested edit was applied successfully. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Done — I added the line "The cast is amazing!" to your post. I confirmed the submission was edited and the line now appears in the post body. Short URL: http://10.10.0.120:9999/70929\n\nWould you like me to make any other edits, revert this change, or share the post?'
