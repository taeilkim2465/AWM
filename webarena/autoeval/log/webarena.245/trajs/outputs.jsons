{"id": 245, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the name of the customer most unhappy with \"Antonia racer tank\" (lowest-rated reviewer). The agent only asked a clarification (\"Do you mean the product named exactly...\") and did not search for that product or retrieve any review information. The final page snapshot shows the Products grid with a different active filter (\"Pursuit Tone Band\") and \"We couldn't find any records,\" so no reviewer was returned or explicitly reported as unavailable. Therefore the agent did not complete the information-seeking task.", "status": "failure"}}
