## Intent

Presents the monthly count of successful orders from May to December 2022 in MM:COUNT format

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for monthly counts of successful orders May–Dec 2022. The agent attempted to set date filters and status=Complete, but the page shows an invalid purchase date filter ("Purchase Date: 12/02/0002 - Invalid date") and the visible orders are from 2023 (e.g., May 19, 2023), not 2022. No monthly MM:COUNT breakdown is shown or exported. Therefore the agent did not produce the requested month-by-month counts for May–Dec 2022.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they remind me to confirm how dates are displayed before counting orders — that's important for accurate month assignment.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories because they are directly relevant before I interpret order dates:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they remind me to confirm how dates are displayed before counting — this page shows full month names (e.g., "May 31, 2023 2:55:09 AM"), so the month is unambiguous (Memory 1, Memory 2, Memory 3 are relevant and I will use them).
===============INFO - Memory 1, Memory 2, Memory 3: I will use these memories — they all remind me to verify the page's date format before applying date filters. I checked the table and the Purchase Date values use the format "Mon DD, YYYY ..." (for example "Dec 30, 2022 8:48:54 AM"), so entering dates with the month name (e.g., "May 1, 2022" and "Dec 31, 2022") should match the page's locale and avoid day/month ambiguity.
===============INFO - Memory 1, 2, 3 are all about confirming date format before interpreting date filters. I will use them because the active filter currently shows "Invalid date" (the date inputs we previously filled used a textual month format). That suggests the page expects numeric MM/DD/YYYY (or similar). To fix the invalid date filter I will clear the date fields and enter the dates in MM/DD/YYYY format (05/01/2022 – 12/31/2022), re-select Status = Complete to be safe, then apply the search so the list is correctly filtered to orders May–Dec 2022. After the filter is applied I can count the orders per month (next step).
===============INFO - I will use the memory items to avoid date-format mistakes:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Confirm displayed date format and timezone context — I will use this. The page shows dates like "Dec 24, 2022 11:19:55 PM" (month name present), so month parsing is unambiguous and I don't need timezone adjustments for just month counts, but it's important I noted this.
