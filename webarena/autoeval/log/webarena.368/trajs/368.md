## Intent

find discounted items.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent repeatedly searched for "discount" and "sale" and adjusted sorting, but ended on a single product page for a Zebra printhead showing a single price ($471.65) with no sale/discount price or "discount" label visible. For an information-seeking task to "find discounted items," the agent needed to present discounted items (or explicitly report none found). The final page does not show a discount nor a list of discounted items, so the user's intent was not satisfied. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm conditional discounts from order metadata): I will NOT use this — it's about verifying discounts from order metadata on an order detail page, which doesn't apply to browsing product search results.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm conditional discounts from order metadata): I will not use this memory now — it applies to verifying conditional discounts in an order's metadata, but I'm currently browsing product search results, not order details.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm conditional discounts from order metadata" — Not needed right now. I'm searching the site for discounted items, not verifying conditional discounts on an order.
