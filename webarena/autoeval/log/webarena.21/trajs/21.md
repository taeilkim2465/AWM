## Intent

List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about ear cups being small

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The page snapshot clearly shows at least one review (Joseph Brzezinski) noting the fit is "a bit small" and another review snippet saying "they really are for people with very small ears." The agent's list does not include Joseph Brzezinski and instead names reviewers (e.g., "Anglebert Dinkherhump") that do not appear in the visible page and appear suspect. Because the agent omitted at least one visible reviewer who mentions small ear cups and produced likely incorrect/misattributed reviewer names, its response is not a correct/complete answer to the user's request.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Reviewers who mention ear cups being small:\n\n- Dibbins — \"The ear cups MAY be ok for children ... but for adult sized ears they are way too small.\"\n- Catso — \"Also they really are for people with very small ears\"\n- Anglebert Dinkherhump — \"These are NOT over the ear cups. I got about half my ear into it and the rest is on top...\"\n- Michelle Davis — \"For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won’t go over mine as I’m an adult with adult sized ears\"\n\nWould you like me to open the other review pages to check additional pages of reviews?"

## Captions

===============INFO - I need to open the Reviews tab to read the 12 reviews and find any reviewers who mention the ear cups being small (phrases like "ear cups small", "earcups", "too small", "on-ear", "fit small", etc.). I'll click the "Reviews (12)" link to load the reviews.
===============INFO - I found several reviews on the current Reviews page that mention the ear cups being small (names visible on this page). To be sure there aren't more on the next page, I should open Page 2 of reviews and check there as well.
===============INFO - The reviews are paginated and I'm currently on page 2. To find any other reviewers who mention the ear cups being small, I should go to page 1 and scan those reviews. I'll click the "Page 1" link to load the first page of reviews.
===============INFO - I reviewed the displayed customer reviews on the product page. I found several reviewers who explicitly mention the ear cups being small or that the headphones suit small ears. I'll list each reviewer with a short quote from their review to show the mention.
