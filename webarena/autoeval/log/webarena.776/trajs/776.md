===============INFO - I'll use the provided memories as guidance:
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. I will not delete anything immediately — I will first open and verify each matched review's full content and metadata before deleting to avoid false positives.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows before taking the next action:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify each candidate...) — I will use this. Before deleting anything I must open full review records and confirm details so I don't remove the wrong items.
===============INFO - Memory item 1: Verify each candidate with full review details and multiple metadata fields before deletion — I will use this. I must open each matched review to confirm author identifiers and content before deleting.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify each candidate...) — I will use this. We must not delete based solely on the filter; before any deletion I will open and inspect each full review record to confirm author identifiers and content.
===============INFO - I will use the remembered guidance before acting:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify each candidate with full review details): I will use this. Even if we find matches, I must open each review and confirm author identifiers and content before deleting to avoid false positives.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify each candidate...) — I will use this. We must open and confirm full review records and metadata before deleting, so I will not delete anything without verifying details.
