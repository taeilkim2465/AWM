## Intent

Draft an email to the shop owner via their contact us function for a coupon as they promised me a coupon last time

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the contact form with the user's message, submitted it (click '1748'), and the page shows the confirmation banner "Thanks for contacting us..." indicating the message was sent. The agent also informed the user and offered sensible next options (add details, wait, or edit), so the task of drafting/sending the contact message was completed successfully.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I submitted the contact form — the page shows a confirmation: \"Thanks for contacting us with your comments and questions. We'll respond to you very soon.\" Below is the exact message I sent. Would you like to add anything (order number, phone, or other details
