## Intent

What is the total count of Not Approved reviews amongst all the reviews?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the "Not Approved" status filter and performed the search. The page clearly shows "0 records found" and the message "We couldn't find any records." Therefore the agent's reply that there are 0 Not Approved reviews is correct and the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'There are 0 Not Approved reviews in total. Would you like me to clear the filter or check another status?'

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Exhaustively traverse paginated reviews before concluding" — I will use this. It reminds me to confirm pagination before reporting totals.
