{"id": 543, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The final page snapshot still shows the original product description HTML (no quoted user review comments) and there is no evidence the description text was edited to add or highlight real user positive reviews.

Therefore the task to update the description with quoted comments was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
