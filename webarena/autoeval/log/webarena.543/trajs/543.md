## Intent

Update the product description of Bella Tank to highlight the real user positive reviews by quoting the comments

## RM

Thoughts: The final page snapshot still shows the original product description HTML (no quoted user review comments) and there is no evidence the description text was edited to add or highlight real user positive reviews. The action history shows clicks and a final Enter press but no explicit edit/replace of the description content or a successful Save action that would reflect the requested changes. Therefore the task to update the description with quoted comments was not completed.
Status: "failure"
