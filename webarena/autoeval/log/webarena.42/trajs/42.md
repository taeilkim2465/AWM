## Intent

List the top 2 search terms in my store

## RM

Thoughts: The agent provided the requested information — the top two search terms with their Results, Uses, and rank — and noted the reporting period and ranking method. It also offered relevant next steps. The webpage snapshot doesn't contradict this. This meets the information-seeking success criteria.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Here are the top 2 search terms from your Dashboard > Top Search Terms:\n\n1

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — the Dashboard already shows a "Top Search Terms" table, so I don't need to navigate to a separate list page right now.

## Main Prompt

```md
User Intent: List the top 2 search terms in my store

Action History:
1: send_msg_to_user("Here are the top 2 search terms from your Dashboard > Top Search Terms:\n\n1) hollister — Results: 1, Uses: 19 (Rank #1)\n2) Joust Bag — Results: 10, Uses: 4 (Rank #2)\n\nReporting period: Not shown on the Dashboard (appears to be overall/top terms). Ranking method: sorted by Uses (descending). Tie-breaker not indicated in the UI.\n\nNext steps I can take: open the Search Terms management page to verify or export, change the store scope/date range if available, or show more ranked terms. Which would you like me to do?")
