## Intent

Tell me the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Hunt library

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Hunt Library. The agent's actions only show searches for "Hunt Library Carnegie Mellon University" and clicks, and the final page snapshot is a generic Nominatim map with no search results or nearby POIs listed. No restaurant information (or an explicit "not available" message) was returned, so the information-seeking task was not completed successfully. 
Status: "failure"
