## Intent

Create a new private project "planner" and add Abishek, Vinta as members

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot shows the "planner" project exists (Project name "planner", Project ID 208), so creation succeeded, but the General Settings page does not show or confirm a private visibility setting and there is no evidence in the final state that Abishek or Vinta were added as members. The action history contains multiple attempts to fill member fields but ends on the General Settings page rather than a Members list or confirmation, so membership additions were not verified or completed. Therefore the overall task (create private project and add members) was not fully accomplished.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites): I will use this. After creating the project I should open the project's Members view to confirm Abishek and Vinta are not already members or invited before sending invites, to avoid duplicates.
===============INFO - I'll review the memory items first and decide whether to use them now:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites): Relevant for the later step when inviting Abishek and Vinta. I will not use it right now but I will follow it after the project is created (i.e., check members/pending invites before sending invites).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to check current members or pending invites before inviting — that avoids duplicate invites. Memory 2 and Memory 3 are not relevant to adding members, so I won't use them now.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites): I will use this — it's important to verify Abishek and Vinta are not already members or invited before sending invites.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites) is relevant — I will use it to search the project's members list for "Abishek" and "Vinta" before sending invites to avoid duplicates.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites before inviting): I will use this — it's relevant to avoid duplicate invites. I see the current members list (only "Byte Blaze") so inviting Abishek and Vinta is appropriate.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites): I will use this. I'll search the members list for "Abishek" and "Vinta" first to avoid duplicate invites.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 to remember to check current members and pending invites before inviting anyone (to avoid duplicate invites). Memory 2 and Memory 3 are not relevant for adding members or setting project visibility, so I will not use them.
