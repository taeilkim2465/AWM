## Intent

Create a new public project "AutoAGI" and add primer as members

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot shows the AutoAGI project exists (breadcrumb/title) and the Members page is open, but the members list only contains "Byte Blaze" (Owner). Although the action history includes steps that look like attempts to add "primer" (fills and clicks), there is no "primer" member in the final members list. The project creation succeeded but the requested addition of "primer" as a member did not complete successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (check current members before inviting) because it reminds me to verify that "primer" isn't already a member or already invited before sending an invite. Memory 2 (merge request check) is irrelevant for this task, so I will not use it. Memory 3 (use project entry metadata to assess visibility) isn't directly needed to create a new project, but it can be useful to confirm the created project's visibility — I'll keep it in mind but not explicitly use it now.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check current members and pending invites before inviting" — I will NOT use this right now because we're still at the project creation step. I will use this memory later before sending any membership invite to avoid duplicate invites.
===============INFO - I'll consider the provided memories before acting:
===============INFO - We need to add the user "primer" as a member to the newly created public project.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites): I will use this — it's important to confirm "primer" isn't already a member or already invited before sending an invite.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites) because I should verify that "primer" isn't already a member before sending an invite. I'll use the members filter on this page to search for "primer".
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites) to verify whether "primer" is already a member or has a pending invite before sending a new invite — this avoids duplicate invites. I will not use Memory 2 (merge request guidance) because it's not relevant to adding members. I will keep Memory 3 in mind (project visibility metadata) because I may need to confirm/set the project's visibility to public after adding the member, but I won't act on it yet.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members) — I will use this: before inviting "primer" I should confirm they're not already a member or already invited. I already searched the members list for "primer" (filtered), but I'll re-check the members/invite UI when inviting as a final confirmation.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. I will check the project's Members view to confirm "primer" is not already a member or invited before sending a new invite, to avoid duplicates.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check current members and pending invites): I will use this. It is directly relevant — before inviting "primer" I should open the project's Members view and search for the user to avoid duplicate invites.
