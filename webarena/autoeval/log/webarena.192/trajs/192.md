## Intent

Tell me the total cost of my latest non-cancelled order?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the total cost of their latest non-cancelled order. The agent's message identifies the latest non-cancelled order (#000000189, 5/2/23) and gives the order total ($754.99), and explicitly notes a more recent order is canceled. The response supplies the requested information, so the task is completed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Your latest non-cancelled order is #000000189 (date: 5/2/23
