## Intent

Open my latest updated issue that has keyword "theme editor" in its title to check if it is closed

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened the issue titled "Tm Theme Editor" (which contains "theme editor") and the page screenshot clearly shows the green "Open" status and a "Close issue" button. The agent correctly reported the issue is Open and offered next actions, fulfilling the user's request to open the (latest) matching issue and check if it is closed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (filter by title keyword then sort by last-updated) because the user asked for the most recently updated issue with "theme editor" in its title. I will not use Memory 2 (verify public-facing profile view) because that's about confirming saved profile changes, which is unrelated. I will not use Memory 3 (default assumptions about labels/state) because the user specifically wants the latest updated issue with the keyword and to check whether it is closed — no label/state defaults are needed.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it instructs to filter by title keyword and pick the most recently updated match — that helps ensure we open the latest updated issue with "theme editor" in its title. Memory 2 is not relevant (it's about verifying public profile views after saving). Memory 3 is not relevant here (it's about default label/state assumptions for vague filters).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it's directly relevant: when asked for the "latest updated" issue with a title keyword, first filter by title then pick the most recently updated. I'll apply that approach.
