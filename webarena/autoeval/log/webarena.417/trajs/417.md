## Intent

Go to the merge request on 404 link I have to review, find if the author of the merge request responded at the end, and reply "Thank you" if he did. Otherwise remind him with a simple @.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the merge request, scrolled to the end and observed the latest comment is from the author (Byte Blaze) saying "Thank you". It then filled the comment box with "Thank you" and clicked to post. That matches the user's instruction to reply "Thank you" if the author responded, so the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they directly describe the task steps: Memory 1 tells me to check the latest comment to see if the MR author responded and reply accordingly, and Memory 2 tells me to locate the target MR from the project's Merge Requests list. I will not use Memory 3 because it concerns creating MRs for sensitive changes, which is unrelated to this review task.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this later — it instructs how to check the end of the discussion and reply minimally ("Thank you" or a short @reminder). For now I need to find the merge request page first.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to check the end of the discussion and reply minimally; this is exactly what the user requested after I open the MR.
===============INFO - I'll first consider the memory items:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Check the end of the discussion and reply with a minimal message) because the task requires checking the latest comment and replying either "Thank you" or a simple mention reminder. I will use Memory 2 (Find the target merge request from the project's Merge Requests list) because I need to locate the specific MR first. I will not use Memory 3 (Prefer creating a merge request...) because it's not relevant to this review/reply task.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they directly match the task: find the target merge request in the project's Merge Requests list and check the end of the discussion to reply minimally. I will not use Memory 3 because it's about creating MRs for sensitive changes and is irrelevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it directly matches the required behavior (check the end of the discussion and reply minimally).
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it directly matches the task: check the end of the discussion to see who posted last and reply accordingly. Memory 2 is not needed because we're already on the specific merge request page. Memory 3 is irrelevant to this task.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it directly matches the user's instruction to check the end of the discussion and reply minimally.
