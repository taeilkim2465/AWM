## Intent

Notify Alex Thomas in their most recent pending order with message "Yo, your order will be shipped soon!"

## RM

Thoughts: The order page (#000000304) shows the comment "Yo, your order will be shipped soon!" in the order history and indicates "Customer Notified" while the order status is Pending. This matches the user's intent to notify Alex Thomas on their pending order with that exact message, so the agent completed the task successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Avoid selecting in-progress/completed orders): Not relevant — the user specifically asked to notify the most recent pending order, so I will not use this memory.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 because it tells me to filter for pending orders and sort by date when looking for the most recent pending order — that's directly relevant to notifying Alex Thomas about their most recent pending order. I will not use Memory 1 (it's about selecting completed orders, which is not relevant here) nor Memory 3 (it's about canceled orders, also not relevant).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Avoid selecting in-progress orders): Not needed — the user asked to notify a pending order, not to find a completed one, so I will not use this memory.
===============INFO - Memory usage:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It warns about selecting completed orders only — that is irrelevant because the user asked to notify the most recent pending order.
