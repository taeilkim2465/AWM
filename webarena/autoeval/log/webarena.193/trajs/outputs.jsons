The agent only asked a clarifying question (grand total vs subtotal and what \"last 2 completed orders\" means) and did not return the requested totals or state they were unavailable. Per the information-seeking task criteria, the agent must provide the requested information or explicitly state it can't be obtained. Because the agent did not provide the totals and is still awaiting the user's clarification, the task is incomplete.", "status": "failure"}}
