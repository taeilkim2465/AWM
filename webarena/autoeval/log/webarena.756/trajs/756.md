## Intent

Create a private JEKYLL repository called "11711_gitlab" using the right template to speed up development.

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the existing "jekyll" example project (breadcrumb "GitLab Pages examples / jekyll") rather than a newly created repository named "11711_gitlab". There's no indication the repo was created or set to private (no project name "11711_gitlab" or privacy setting shown). Therefore the agent did not complete the requested creation of a private JEKYLL repository with the specified name and template.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Pick an appropriate starter template early in the flow): I will use this — selecting the Jekyll template during project creation will add the correct scaffolding automatically and speed development.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Pick an appropriate starter template early in the flow" — I will use this memory. It reminds me to choose a template that matches Jekyll so the repo is pre-populated with the right files.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they remind me to select the correct starter template early and verify the selection before proceeding. I will also use Memory 2 (initialize with a README) later when the project creation form appears, but not for this immediate click—I'll confirm the template first.
===============INFO - I will use the memories that are relevant:
