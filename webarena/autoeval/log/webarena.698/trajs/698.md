## Intent

Add a simple product named Lelelumon Yoga Mat with 42 in stock, available in size uni-size and color black, priced at $769.99

## RM

Thoughts: The actions show the agent filled Name, URL key, Price, Quantity and set stock status, but there is no explicit "Save" action or confirmation message in the final page snapshot. The snapshot is the Products grid (2042 records found) and does not show the new "Lelelumon Yoga Mat" entry or any success notification. Also required fields like SKU/attribute set don't appear completed in the history. Therefore the product was not successfully added.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Create or assign variant combinations and verify immediately" — Not needed. I'm creating a simple (not configurable) product, so variant combination steps aren't required.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Create or assign variant combinations and verify immediately): I will not use this memory now. It applies to configurable products and managing variant lists; the user asked for a simple product, so variant creation/assignment is not needed.
===============INFO - We need to add a simple product. Review memories:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (Confirm attribute options exist) because before creating the simple product I should verify that the size and color attribute options (uni-size, black) are available on the product form or add them first if missing. I will not use Memory 1 or Memory 3 because those focus on configurable products and creating/assigning variant combinations, which is not needed for this simple product.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Create/assign variant combos) is for configurable products — not needed for this simple product, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it concerns configurable products and creating/assigning size across color variants. This is a simple product, so that workflow doesn't apply.
