## Intent

Tell me when I last ordered my muffin cornbread mix?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked when they last ordered "muffin cornbread mix" (information-seeking). The final page shows Order #000000170 dated May 17, 2023, but the listed items are a lamp, coat rack, etc.—the muffin cornbread mix is not shown. The agent did not locate or report a matching order or explicitly state the item isn’t found, so it did not provide the requested information.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (explicit reply instructions): I will NOT use this — it's a general guideline about reply formatting, not needed to locate the order.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (check for newer cancelled orders) because when I report the "last" order that includes a product, I need to verify whether a newer order was cancelled so I don't mistakenly report an older active order. Memories 1 and 2 are not needed for this step (they are about reply templates and default assumptions).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (explicit reply instructions) — I will NOT use this memory; it's about how I format replies and isn't needed to find the order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Include explicit reply instructions..." — I will NOT use this. It’s a general UI guideline for replies, not needed to find order history.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (explicit reply instructions) — do not use: it's not relevant to finding order details.
