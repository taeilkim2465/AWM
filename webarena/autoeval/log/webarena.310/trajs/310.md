## Intent

Tell me who has made the most contributions, in terms of number of commits, to the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project

## RM

Thoughts: The Contributors page in the snapshot clearly shows "tokudu 150 commits" as the top entry, and the agent's final message reported exactly that. The agent found and reported the requested information correctly.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'The top contributor is "tokudu" with 150 commits (per the project\'s Contributors page

===============INFO - Memory 1, 2, 3: I will use these — they all recommend opening the repository's Contributors/Insights view to get authoritative per-contributor commit counts. That is exactly the target metric, so I'll navigate to the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project and open its Contributors/Insights page.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items that say to check the repository's Contributors/Insights view for authoritative commit counts (Memory 1, 2, and 3) because they directly answer who has the most commits. Next I'll search for the AndroidSlidingUpPanel repository in the top search box, open the repo page, and then navigate to Insights → Contributors to read the per-contributor commit totals.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories that say the repository's Contributors/Insights view is the authoritative place to get per-contributor commit counts (Memory 1, Memory 2, Memory 3). All three memories are relevant and I will follow them: after locating the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project, I will open its Contributors/Insights page to read the commit totals.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It says to open the project's Contributors/Insights view to read commit totals — that's the authoritative source for who has the most commits, so I'll follow that.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the repository's Contributors view for commit counts — I will use this (relevant and authoritative).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the repository's Contributors view for commit counts — I will use this memory (yes). It explicitly recommends opening the Contributors/Insights view to get authoritative per-contributor commit totals.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it says to read the repository's Contributors view for commit counts. The current page is exactly the Contributors view, so it's directly applicable.
