## Intent

Find the parking around CMU main campus

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted parking around CMU main campus (information seeking). The action history shows multiple search attempts, but the final page snapshot is a world map with no search results, markers, or listings for parking near Carnegie Mellon. The agent did not present parking locations or state that none were found, so it did not satisfy the information request.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items to refine the search because the current query returned "No results found".
===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide the next search.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It recommends centering POI queries on campus coordinates and using explicit parking keywords — that's directly relevant for finding nearby parking and will guide follow-up searches if zooming doesn't expose clickable POIs.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The search on this page returned "No results found"; Memory 1 recommends running a POI-style query centered on the campus coordinates and using explicit parking keywords (e.g., "parking garage", "parking lot", "public parking"). I'll follow that approach next (likely via the Nominatim search or by refining the query).
