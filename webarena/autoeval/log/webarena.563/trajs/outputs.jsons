{"id": 563, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The project \"fun_thing_to_do\" was created and a README was added and merged (screenshot shows the merged commit), so the repo exists. However the README contains links to r/DIY top pages by time range rather than direct links to the current \"most active 5 DIY ideas\" (i.e., the top 5 individual posts). The user's intent requested links to the most active 5 DIY ideas; the README only provides aggregate/top-listing pages and offers to fetch individual posts later, so it does not fully satisfy the user's requirement.", "status": "failure"}}
