{"id": 284, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the least expensive shoe storage that holds at least 12 pairs. The agent returned one candidate (KingPavonini 4-Tier) at $19.99 and asked whether to select it or keep searching, but did not verify that it is the least expensive matching item site-wide. The agent also misreported the capacity (agent said \"stores up to 16 pairs\" while the product page title clearly states \"Holds up to 20 Pairs\"), so the information is inaccurate and incomplete for an information-seeking task. Therefore the task was not successfully completed.", "status": "failure"}}
