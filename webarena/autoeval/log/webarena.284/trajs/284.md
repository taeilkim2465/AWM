## Intent

Show the least expensive shoe storage with a minimum storage capacity of 12 pairs.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the least expensive shoe storage that holds at least 12 pairs. The agent returned one candidate (KingPavonini 4-Tier) at $19.99 and asked whether to select it or keep searching, but did not verify that it is the least expensive matching item site-wide. The agent also misreported the capacity (agent said "stores up to 16 pairs" while the product page title clearly states "Holds up to 20 Pairs"), so the information is inaccurate and incomplete for an information-seeking task. Therefore the task was not successfully completed. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I will use targeted search keywords including the item type and capacity (e.g., "shoe storage 12 pairs") to surface relevant products.

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use targeted search keywords for storage solutions — I will use this (yes). Narrowing the query should surface shoe-storage-specific results instead of general items.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (targeted search keywords): I will use this — it will help if I need to refine the search later (e.g., add "12 pairs" and "capacity") to surface only items meeting the capacity requirement.
===============INFO - I will use targeted search keywords including a capacity hint to surface products that meet the >=12-pair requirement.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 to run a targeted search for shoe storage that specifies the desired capacity (12 pairs) so results are more relevant. Memory 2 (verify capacity and internal layout on product pages) is also useful, but I will apply it after I find candidate listings — so I will not use it right now, only keep it in mind for product page checks.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as follows before taking action:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (targeted search keywords): I will not use it right now — we're already on a product page, not running a new search.
