{"id": 236, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the nearest pharmacy within a 20-minute walk from Carnegie Mellon (information seeking). The agent only asked a clarification about which CMU location to use and then clicked on the page; the final map snapshot shows the OpenStreetMap view and a welcome panel but no search results, no pharmacy identified, and no walking-time estimate. For an information-seeking task the agent must return the pharmacy location (or explicitly say none found). That did not happen, so the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
