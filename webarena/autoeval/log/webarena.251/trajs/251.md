## Intent

Tell me the coordinates of bus stop on the Carnegie art museum side of the street near CMU in DD format

## RM

Thoughts: The agent located the map center Geo URI on OpenStreetMap (visible in the snapshot as geo:40.44365,-79.94956?z=19) and returned the coordinates in decimal degrees with hemisphere clarification and a note about the source. That matches the user's request for DD coordinates of the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of Forbes Ave near CMU, so the execution is correct and sufficient. 
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory check — I'll decide whether to use each memory item before acting:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Include landmark and side-of-street in map searches): I will use this — the user explicitly asked for the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of the street, so I must include the landmark and side-of-street in the search query.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because the user explicitly asked for the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of the street — I need to respect the side-of-street instruction when locating the correct stop. I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3 because the user asked for coordinates in DD format and those memories remind me to return decimal-degree coordinates with a short hemisphere clarification.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The user asked specifically for the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of the street, so I should include the landmark and the side-of-street in the search query to avoid default/incorrect stops.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. The user asked specifically for the stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of the street; I will respect that preference when reporting the coordinates shown on the map.
