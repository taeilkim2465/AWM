## Intent

Reduce the price of size 28 Sahara leggings by 13.5%

## RM

Thoughts: The product shown is "Sahara Leggings-28-Blue" (size 28). The action history shows the price field was iteratively changed, with the value 36.32 entered (step 19–20) and finally set to 31.42 (step 22–23). 36.32 × (1 − 0.135) = 36.32 × 0.865 ≈ 31.41–31.42, so the final price $31.42 reflects a 13.5% reduction of the original $36.32. The page snapshot confirms the Price field now shows $31.42.  
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compute accurate per‑unit price from pack sizes and promotions): I will not use this — we're editing a single product's price, not computing per-unit pricing from bundles or promotions.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (Increase results-per-page) because once I open the Products grid it will help to show more items per page and make it easier to find the Sahara leggings. I will NOT use Memory 1 (compute per‑unit price) — this task only requires updating a single product's price, not computing per-unit prices. I will NOT use Memory 3 (multi-leg routing) because it's unrelated.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (compute per-unit price): Not needed — this task is to change a single product variant price, not to compute per-unit prices from packs.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (compute per-unit price): Not relevant — this task is a straight price update on a single-size product, not computing per-unit prices for multi-packs, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - We need to reduce the price of the size 28 Sahara Leggings by 13.5%. I will decide whether to use each memory item first:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Compute accurate per‑unit price..." — Not using. This product has a single-unit price shown (no multi-pack info), so per‑unit conversion is not needed.
===============INFO - Memory use:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (compute per‑unit price from pack sizes): Not relevant — we're editing a single product price, no multi-pack/unit conversions needed.
===============INFO - Memory check:
