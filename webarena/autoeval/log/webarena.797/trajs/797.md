## Intent

Change the delivery address for my most recent order to 3 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA.

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the "My Orders" list, not an order details or address-edit screen. There is no evidence the agent opened the most recent order or edited its shipping address (no address fields, save button, or confirmation shown). The action history only contains repeated clicks that left the user on the orders list, so the delivery address was not changed to "3 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA."
Status: "failure"
