## Intent

Show me products under $78 in "children dental care" category

## RM

Thoughts: The user requested products under $78 in "children dental care". The agent only performed a search for "children dental care" (action 11-12) and the page shows general search results (items 1-12 of 18651) with product images but no price filtering applied or any list of items explicitly under $78. The agent did not apply a price filter, sort by price, or extract and return products priced below $78, nor did it state that such a filter/result was unavailable. Therefore the task requirements were not met.
Status: "failure"
