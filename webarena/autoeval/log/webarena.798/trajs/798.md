## Intent

Change the delivery address for my most recent order to 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to change the delivery address for their most recent order to 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA. The action history shows repeated clicks but the final page snapshot remains the "My Orders" list (showing "View Order | Reorder" actions) and does not show any order details or an address-edit/confirmation screen. There is no evidence the agent opened the most recent order or updated the shipping address, nor is there any confirmation of the new address. Therefore the requested address change was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Confirm order editability before attempting an address change — I will use this. I need to check the order status and look for an explicit "change/edit delivery address" control on the order details page before attempting to change the address.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm order editability): I will use this. The order page shows the order status ("Canceled"), so per Memory 1 I must check whether this specific order can be edited before attempting an address change. If there's no edit control or the status disallows changes, I should use a fallback.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It reminds me to verify whether the order is editable before changing the address. I'll navigate to My Orders to check the most recent order's status and look for an edit/change delivery address control.
