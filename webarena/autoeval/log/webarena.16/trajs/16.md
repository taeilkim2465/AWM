## Intent

Compare the time for walking and driving route from 5000 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh to UPMC family health center

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to compare walking and driving times. The final page snapshot and directions panel only show the Foot (OSRM) route with "Distance: 1.2km. Time: 0:16." There is no visible driving route or driving time shown, and although the action history toggled the mode multiple times, the final state lacks the car duration needed for a comparison. Therefore the agent did not provide both times or the requested comparison.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use all three memory items:

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it instructs to use walking-mode routing and present walking time/route; I'll follow it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (compute and report walkability using walking-mode routing): I will use this memory — the page already shows walking-mode routing and a walking time (0:16), so I should keep that as the walking reference.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use walking-mode routing and compare walking time/distance — I will use this. The page currently shows Foot (OSRM) directions (Distance 1.2 km, Time 0:16), so walking mode is already used.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use walking-mode routing — YES. The user asked to compare walking and driving times; I should get a walking estimate using the walking profile rather than straight-line or driving estimates.
