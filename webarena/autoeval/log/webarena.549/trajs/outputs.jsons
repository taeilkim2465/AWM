{"id": 549, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The screenshot shows the \"Size\" attribute options and there is no \"XXXL\" (or 3XL) present; only sizes like XS, S, M, L, XL and various numeric/cms values are shown. The action history contains clicks within the configuration wizard but no action that adds a new size value or saves a new attribute option. Also the Color section (for green) is visible but green is not shown/selected in the visible portion. Because the new XXXL size was not added to the Size options (and there's no evidence a new option was created or saved), the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
