## Intent

Add a new size XXXL to green Minerva LumaTech V-Tee

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot shows the "Size" attribute options and there is no "XXXL" (or 3XL) present; only sizes like XS, S, M, L, XL and various numeric/cms values are shown. The action history contains clicks within the configuration wizard but no action that adds a new size value or saves a new attribute option. Also the Color section (for green) is visible but green is not shown/selected in the visible portion. Because the new XXXL size was not added to the Size options (and there's no evidence a new option was created or saved), the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 is relevant: I should set the variant scope (size group) before adding a new option so the XXXL size is added to the correct variant group. I will use Memory 1.
===============INFO - Memory 1 is relevant and I will use it: when I edit the configurable product I must set the variant scope (size) before adding a new size option so the change attaches to the correct variants. Memories 2 and 3 (about inserting post body paragraphs) are not relevant to this task.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Set the variant scope before adding an attribute) is relevant — I will use it because when adding a size that should apply only to a specific variant (green), I need to scope the change to that variant group first so the new size is added in the right place.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 is relevant: I should set the variant/attribute scope (size) before adding an option so the new size applies to the right variants. I'll use this memory to remind myself to work within the product's Configurations editor rather than adding a global attribute.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It reminds me to set the variant scope (size) before adding an attribute or option so the change is applied to the correct variant group. This is relevant because we're adding a new size (XXXL) for a particular color variant (Green).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Set the variant scope before adding an attribute) is relevant — I will use it because we need to add a size specifically for the green variant, so I must make sure we edit the configurations/variant scope (Edit Configurations) rather than creating a global size option.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Set the variant scope before adding an attribute like color): I will use this — it's relevant because we need to add a new size option (XXXL) and possibly scope it correctly before assigning color-specific changes. The current modal is Step 1 (Select Attributes) and we should proceed to Step 2 (Attribute Values) so we can set the size values/scope.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Set the variant scope before adding an attribute like color): I will use this memory — it's relevant because when adding a new size option I should ensure I edit the correct product attribute (Size) so the new option is applied correctly to the product variants.
