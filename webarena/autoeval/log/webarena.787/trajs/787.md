## Intent

Tell me the number of followers of the contributor who has the most commits to branch main

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the follower count of the contributor with the most commits to branch "main". The action history and final snapshot show only the repository Branches view (showing "master" and a single commit) after filtering; there is no information about contributors, commit counts per contributor on the main branch, or any follower counts visible. The agent did not navigate to a contributors or user profile page nor extract commit stats, so it cannot answer the user's question from the final state.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 and Memory 3 are relevant: they confirm the Contributors/Insights view is the authoritative source for who has the most commits, and we should rely on that view for identifying the top contributor. I will use those memories to justify selecting the top contributor shown on this Contributors page.
===============INFO - I will use the repository's Contributors view (Memory 1) because it provides authoritative per-contributor commit counts and is the right place to identify who has the most commits. I will also use the guidance to prefer the contributors/insights view or API (Memory 3) if needed to get per-contributor commit counts; that reinforces using this page first. I will not use Memory 2 because it concerns repository access/members, which is not relevant to finding commit counts or follower counts.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Contributors view has authoritative commit counts): USE — it confirms the contributors page is the right place to identify who has the most commits.
===============INFO - Memory 1 and Memory 3 are directly relevant: they say to use the repository's Contributors/Insights view to get per-contributor commit counts, and to use that view or API to identify the top contributor. I will use both (Memory 1: yes, Memory 3: yes). Memory 2 is about member listings vs contributors for access queries, which is not relevant to this task, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Contributors view has authoritative commit counts): YES — I will use this because the Contributors/Insights page is the correct place to determine who has the most commits for a branch.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — the Contributors/Insights view is the authoritative source for per-contributor commit counts and we're already on that page, so I'll rely on it to identify the top contributor.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The Contributors view is the authoritative source for per-contributor commit counts, so I will rely on it to identify the top contributor for the branch.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. The Contributors view is the authoritative place to find who has the most commits for a branch.
===============INFO - I will use the repository Contributors view to find who has the most commits on the specified branch, then check that contributor's profile for their follower count.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. The Contributors/Insights view is authoritative for per-contributor commit counts — this helps identify who has the most commits.
