## Intent

I previously ordered some a table lamp in May 2023 and later cancelled. Can you reorder it for me?

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows a green confirmation banner "You added Uttermost Volterra Crackled Taupe-Gray Ceramic Table Lamp to your shopping cart" and the cart sidebar is open with items listed (cart count 11). That indicates the agent successfully added the requested table lamp to the cart (i.e., reordered it). No error or missing step is visible.
Status: "success"
