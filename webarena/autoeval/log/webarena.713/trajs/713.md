## Intent

Create a best sellers report from 05/01/2022 to 05/31/2023

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the From (5/1/22) and To (5/31/23) fields correctly, but the final page snapshot shows only the filter panel and no generated report results (no bestseller list/table). There's a visible "Show Report" button which appears not to have produced results, so the report was not created/exported. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"
