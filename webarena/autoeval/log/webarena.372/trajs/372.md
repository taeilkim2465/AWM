## Intent

Pull up the description page of the Costco in Pittsburhg near a river on Map

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows only the OpenStreetMap search results list (two Costco entries, one on Waterfront Drive) rather than an individual place description. The agent never opened the specific description/detail page for the river-side (Waterfront) Costco—only performed searches and left the results panel visible. Therefore the requested description page was not pulled up.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory item usage:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (click the place entry or marker to open detailed info) is useful — I'll plan to open any result entry or the map marker to get the description page once results appear.
