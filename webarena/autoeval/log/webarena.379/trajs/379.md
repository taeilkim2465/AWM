## Intent

Find the hotel around CMU main campus

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to find hotels around Carnegie Mellon University's main campus. The action history shows repeated searches for "hotels near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh" and clicks, but the final page snapshot shows a global map with no zoom to Pittsburgh, no result markers or result list visible (no blue circle or listings). Because the page did not display any hotel results or indicate the search succeeded, the agent did not complete the task.
Status: "failure"
