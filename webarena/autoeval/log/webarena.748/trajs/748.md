## Intent

Start a private project web_agent_android_xl with Android template and add primer, convexegg, abishek as members

## RM

Thoughts: The action history only shows clicks and scrolling on a template-selection page; the final snapshot displays various Pages templates with "Use template" buttons. There is no evidence the Android template was selected, no project name field filled with "web_agent_android_xl", no privacy setting changed to private, and no member-invite UI or additions for primer, convexegg, or abishek. Therefore the requested project creation and member additions were not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as guidance:
===============INFO - Memory review:

===============INFO - I will use the provided memories to guide the flow:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it's important to confirm the Android template is actually applied and that the repo starts blank after creation, so I'll remember to verify the files after creating the project.
