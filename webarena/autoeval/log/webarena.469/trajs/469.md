## Intent

Add Light Blue Simple Summer New Low Heels Slippers for Women Fashion Chunky Heels Pointed Toe Wine Glasses Sandals Comfortable Walking Shoes Ladies All-Match Sexy Party Shoes to my wish list

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a green confirmation message explicitly stating the long-named item "has been added to your Wish List" and the "My Wish List" page indicates 5 item(s). The action sequence (search, enter, clicks) led to this confirmation and the updated wishlist, so the add-to-wishlist action succeeded.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they instruct to open the product detail page from the search results and then use the product page's wishlist control — that ensures the wishlist action will be available. I will NOT use Memory 2 (annotating bordering areas) because it is unrelated to adding an item to the wish list.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (follow search → open → add): I will use this — it reminds me to add from the product page after opening the item (we are already on the product page).
