{"id": 64, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked which customer has placed exactly 2 orders. The action history and final screenshot show the Customers grid (email, group, phone, ZIP, country, state, customer since) but there is no \"Order Count\" column visible and the agent never opened an individual customer's details or an orders report to view order totals. Therefore the displayed page does not provide the information needed to determine who has 2 orders, so the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
