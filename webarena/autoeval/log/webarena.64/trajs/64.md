## Intent

Which customer has placed 2 orders in the entire history?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked which customer has placed exactly 2 orders. The action history and final screenshot show the Customers grid (email, group, phone, ZIP, country, state, customer since) but there is no "Order Count" column visible and the agent never opened an individual customer's details or an orders report to view order totals. Therefore the displayed page does not provide the information needed to determine who has 2 orders, so the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Exhaustively check pagination): I will use this — after I get to the customers list I should check pagination to ensure I count all customers/orders.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Exhaustively check pagination): I will use this. If we find orders or customer lists, I must check all pages before concluding counts.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (exhaustively check pagination): I will use this — if I need to compute counts I must ensure all pages or the exported data are considered.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Exhaustively check pagination): I will keep this in mind for later (useful if the export or table view is paginated). For now I don't need to iterate pages because the UI shows "70 records found" and an export option is available. -> NOT used right now, but noted.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Exhaustively check pagination): Yes — I will keep this in mind and use the table's per-page setting (it's already at 100) and ensure any filtering/sorting covers all visible rows. I won't finalize the answer until I can sort or aggregate the Orders column across the full result set or export if needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (exhaustive pagination) is relevant — I will keep it in mind to check all pages if I need to verify order counts across the whole customer list, so I will use it later.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3, and not Memory 2.
