## Intent

Open my latest created issue that has better in its title to check if it is closed

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened the issue titled "Better initial load experience" and correctly reported the issue state as OPEN — the screenshot shows the green "Open" badge and a "Close issue" button, matching the agent's message. This satisfies the user's intent to open their latest issue containing "better" and check if it's closed. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I opened the issue titled \"Better initial load experience\" (byteblaze/empathy-prompts #8
