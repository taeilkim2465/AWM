## Intent

Presents the monthly count of successful orders 01/2023-05/2023 in MM:COUNT format

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only applied the date filter (1/01/2023–5/31/2023) and opened the Export dialog; the page shows "93 records found" but no breakdown by month or counts of successful (completed) orders. The agent also did not filter by order status to select only successful orders, nor did it present MM:COUNT output or indicate the information was unavailable. Because the required monthly counts were not computed or presented, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories about date formats because counting orders per month requires correctly interpreting the order date format and timezone on the Orders page (Memory 1, Memory 2, Memory 3). I will therefore use all three memories to guide me: check the Orders grid for how dates are displayed and the page timezone/locale before counting.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items because they all remind me to verify how dates are shown on the orders page before I count orders, which is important to avoid month/day mix-ups or timezone issues.
===============INFO - Memory usage:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to confirm date interpretation before counting. The page shows purchase dates as "May 31, 2023 2:55:09 AM" (month name present), so dates are unambiguous (Month Day, Year).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories because they all emphasize confirming the page's expected date format before counting — that's directly relevant to the "Invalid date" filter shown on the page.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it warns to confirm date format before matching commits/orders. I'll use it because the page shows month names (e.g., "May 31, 2023 2:55:09 AM"), so I should supply dates with month names to avoid ambiguity.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it — it reminds me to confirm date format before counting.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm the date format before matching commits" — I will use this. It reminds me date input format matters and we should supply the correct format (likely MM/DD/YYYY).
===============INFO - I will use the memory items about date formats (Memory 1, Memory 2, Memory 3) because they are directly relevant: I need to ensure dates are interpreted as month names/dates in the export so counts for Jan–May 2023 map to the right months. Using export is the safest way to get unambiguous timestamps to count successful orders.
