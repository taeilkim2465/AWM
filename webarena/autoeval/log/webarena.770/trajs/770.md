## Intent

We've received 12 white Cora parachute pant of size 28 and 56 blue of size 29, update the inventory.

## RM

Thoughts: The actions only edited the "Cora Parachute Pant-28-White" quantity field (multiple fills ending with an attempt to set 160) but the page snapshot still shows Quantity = 148 and the Save button was never clicked. There is no evidence the blue size 29 item was opened or updated. Because the product changes were not saved and the blue variant was not modified, the inventory update request was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the admin Catalog to find the "Cora parachute pant" product and update the specific variant quantities.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Create or assign variant combinations and verify immediately): I will use this. It’s important to ensure the size option is assigned to the correct color variant so I update the correct SKU (white size 28 and blue size 29). If variants are missing I’ll follow the steps to locate/create the correct simple SKUs before changing stock.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Create/assign variant combinations): Relevant — I may need to ensure the size option exists on the color variants or create simple SKUs. I'll keep this in mind and check variant list after opening the product. So: use Memory 1.
===============INFO - We need to update two variant quantities for this configurable product:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Create or assign variant combinations): Relevant — it reminds me to check that the size/color variant exists before updating. For the white size 28 SKU we're on the simple product page already (SKU WP04-28-White), so we can update its quantity directly. For the blue size 29 variant later, I'll verify the variant exists before updating and use this memory if I need to open configurations or create a simple product.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - We need to update inventory for two simple SKUs: White size 28 (currently open) and Blue size 29 (we'll find after returning to the product list). Current page shows Quantity = 136 for WP04-28-White. We received 12 white size 28, so new quantity = 136 + 12 = 148.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Create or assign variant combinations): Not needed — we're editing existing simple products (White size 28 and Blue size 29), not creating variants.
