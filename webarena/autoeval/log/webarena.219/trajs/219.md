## Intent

Show me the walking distance from nearby hotels to Pittsburgh airport that take at most 3 minutes?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for nearby hotels whose walking time to Pittsburgh airport is at most 3 minutes. The action log shows the agent computed walking directions (Foot (OSRM)) for specific hotels (Hyatt Regency and then Hilton Garden Inn). The visible directions panel shows Distance: 9.8 km, Time: 2:11 (i.e. about 2 hours 11 minutes), far above 3 minutes. The agent did not produce a list of hotels filtered to ≤3 minutes nor did it explicitly state that none exist. Therefore the user's request (show hotels with ≤3 minute walk) was not satisfied. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the located hotel as the origin for targeted nearby-amenity searches): YES — once I find candidate hotels I'll use each hotel's location as the origin for targeted queries to get precise nearby results.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the located hotel as the origin for targeted nearby-amenity searches" — I will not use this right now because I haven't found any hotel yet. Once I find a candidate hotel, I'll use its name/address as the origin.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use located hotel as origin): I will use this if I can find a hotel on the map — it’s helpful for targeted routing. For now I don't have any hotel selected, so I will not directly apply it yet, but I plan to use it once a hotel is found.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (search branded hotel + airport) to find specific hotels that are likely listed near Pittsburgh International Airport — this can surface branded properties quickly. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 1 yet but will use them after I locate a hotel: Memory 1 to set that hotel as the origin for targeted routing, and Memory 2 to request pedestrian walking directions from the hotel's exact location to the airport to get accurate walking times.

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use hotel as origin): I will use this — I'll start with the Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport as an origin to get a precise walking route to the airport.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use located hotel as origin for targeted nearby-amenity searches) — I will use this. Once I locate candidate hotels on the map I'll set each hotel as the "From" origin to get precise walking directions to the airport.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they recommend using a specific hotel as the origin and using pedestrian routing to get accurate walking times — both are directly relevant. Memory 3 (search for a branded hotel together with the airport name) is somewhat useful but not necessary right now; I'll try a likely nearby branded hotel name directly and compute walking time.
