{"id": 219, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for nearby hotels whose walking time to Pittsburgh airport is at most 3 minutes. The action log shows the agent computed walking directions (Foot (OSRM)) for specific hotels (Hyatt Regency and then Hilton Garden Inn). The visible directions panel shows Distance: 9.8 km, Time: 2:11 (i.e. about 2 hours 11 minutes), far above 3 minutes.
