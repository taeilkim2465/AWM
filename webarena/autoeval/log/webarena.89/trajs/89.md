## Intent

Which US states border Connecticut?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked which U.S. states border Connecticut. The agent's reply lists New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, and correctly notes Long Island (New York) is only across a water boundary — this is complete and correct information for the request. The final webpage snapshot is irrelevant to correctness. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Connecticut has 3 land-bordering U.S. states:\n1

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to provide a concise list of a state's land neighbors; that's exactly what the user asked.
