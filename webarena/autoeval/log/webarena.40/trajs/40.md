## Intent

Check if the amc theatre in pittsburgh can be reached in one hour by car from hobart street

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked whether an AMC theatre in Pittsburgh is reachable within one hour by car from Hobart Street. The action history shows the agent filled origin as "Hobart Street, Pittsburgh, PA" and various destination entries ("AMC Theatres, Pittsburgh, PA", "AMC Loews Waterfront 22, Homestead, PA") and interacted with the directions UI (selected "Car (OSRM)"), but the final page snapshot shows only the directions input panel and no computed route, travel time, or distance. No travel-time result or explicit statement was returned. Because the agent did not produce the required travel-time information (or state it was unavailable), the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 (prefer precise origin + nearby/place search sorted by distance) because it recommends using a clear origin and a nearby/place search to reliably find the closest relevant facility — that's directly applicable to checking travel time from Hobart Street to an AMC theatre in Pittsburgh. Memory 1 (ambiguous date formats) and Memory 2 (national park clarification) are not relevant to this task, so I will not use them.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (ambiguous date formats): Not relevant for this task (no dates involved), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Handle ambiguous date formats): Not relevant to this task (no dates involved), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Handle ambiguous date formats): Not relevant — this task is about driving time, not dates, so I will not use this memory.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (prefer precise origin + nearby/place search sorted by distance) because the routing failed previously likely due to an ambiguous destination name. Memory 1 (ambiguous date formats) is not relevant. Memory 2 (national park clarification) is not relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (ambiguous date formats): Not relevant — no dates involved.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (ambiguous date formats): Not relevant for this task — no dates involved.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (ambiguous dates): Not relevant — the user asked about driving time, no dates involved.
