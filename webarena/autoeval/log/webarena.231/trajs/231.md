## Intent

Get the order number of my most recent cancelled order 

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the most recent cancelled order number. The agent's final message directly provides the order number (000000170) with date and total and offers follow-up actions. This satisfies the information-seeking request (no error or missing info reported). 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Your most recent cancelled order number is 000000170 (date: 5/17/23, total: $365.42

===============INFO - Memory 1: Useful — I'll use it. It asks me to note any more recent cancelled orders after I report the latest non-cancelled order; that will help avoid confusion, so I'll call out any newer cancelled orders if they appear.
===============INFO - I'll consider the provided memories before acting.
