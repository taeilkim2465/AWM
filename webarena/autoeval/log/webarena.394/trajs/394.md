## Intent

Fork 2019-nCov.

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows a confirmation banner "The project was successfully forked." and the project header indicates "Forked from yjlou / 2019-nCov", so the fork action completed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Don't request user credentials) — USE. I should not ask for the user's GitLab credentials. If forking requires authentication, I'll present alternatives (show candidate repositories so the user can confirm and fork themselves, give step-by-step instructions, or request an OAuth/permission flow). I'll follow that guidance after locating the repository.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I will not ask for credentials and will offer alternatives if forking needs authentication (show candidates, give step-by-step, or request OAuth). This is relevant because forking requires an authenticated account.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Don't request user credentials) — I will use this. Forking normally requires an authenticated account; I won't ask for your credentials. I will try to open the project page and check whether a "Fork" button is available and whether I'm already authorized. If an authenticated action is required and I can't perform it, I'll present alternatives (instructions for you to fork, list top candidate repos to confirm, or request an OAuth/permission flow).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Don't request user credentials) — forking needs authentication, so I must not ask for credentials and should offer alternatives or instructions if the site prompts for login. I will use Memory 2 (Verify authorization) — I should check whether you are authorized or remind you about contributor/licensing considerations before making changes. I will not use Memory 3 (Prefer contributors/insights) — it's unrelated to forking.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Don't request user credentials) — I will use this. I won't ask for your credentials. Since the page shows the fork form, it looks like I'm already in an authenticated session and can proceed with the UI. If you prefer I cannot perform the fork (e.g., you want to do it yourself), I can instead show instructions or the top candidate namespaces to choose from.
===============INFO - I will use the available memories as follows before acting:
===============INFO - Memory review (deciding whether to use each item):
