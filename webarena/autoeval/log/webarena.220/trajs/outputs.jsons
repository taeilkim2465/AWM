The agent's last message simply asks whether the user wants a 'list' or 'map' and no results are visible on the final page snapshot.

{"id": 220, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for hotels within a \u22645-minute walk to Gardner Steel Conference Center. The agent only performed repeated searches, selected the pedestrian routing engine (Foot (OSRM)), and then asked the user to confirm using ~5 km/h (\u2248400 m) as the pre-filter radius. The final page snapshot shows \"No results found\" for \"hotels in Oakland, Pittsburgh\" and no pedestrian routes or distances were produced or reported to the user. Because the agent never ran or returned confirmed walking distances or a filtered list of hotels \u22645 minutes (it stopped to request a clarification), the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
