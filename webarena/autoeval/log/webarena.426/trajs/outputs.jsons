{"id": 426, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent searched for \"Shanksville, Pennsylvania\" and the map shows the village search result in the left panel. The page displays the town on the map but does not show or open the specific page for the Flight 93 crash site / Flight 93 National Memorial, nor did the agent click \"More results\" or a marker for the memorial. Because the user asked for the page of the place where the plane crashed and the agent only returned the town result (not the memorial page), the task was not completed successfully.", "status": "failure"}}
