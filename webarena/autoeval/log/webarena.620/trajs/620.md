## Intent

Ask for advice about deal with long-distance relationships in a subreddit for relations

## RM

Thoughts: The user intended to post a request for long-distance relationship advice to the subreddit (a content-modification task). The agent did fill and restore the Title and Body, but the final page shows the site error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." and no successful submission was made. While the agent appropriately informed the user of the problem and offered alternatives, it did not complete the requested post. Therefore the task was not completed successfully. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Clarify context and medical history) — Not applicable: the user wants relationship advice, not a medical/symptom request, so we won't use this memory now.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (medical clarification) because this request is about relationship advice, not a health symptom. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 (geographic query heuristics) because they are unrelated to posting in a forum.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (clarify medical context) — not relevant to this task (it's about posting to a forum), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (clarify medical context) — do not use. The post is asking for relationship advice, not medical symptoms, so this memory isn't relevant.
