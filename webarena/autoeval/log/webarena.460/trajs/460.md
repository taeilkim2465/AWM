## Intent

Reduce the price of this product by 15%

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the Price field with $38.25 and clicked the Save control. $38.25 is exactly a 15% reduction of the original $45.00 (45.00 * 0.85 = 38.25), and the final page shows Price = $38.25, so the requested 15% price reduction was applied and saved.
Status: "success"
