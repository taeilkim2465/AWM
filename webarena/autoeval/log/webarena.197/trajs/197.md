Get the total payment amount of the last 5 non-cancelled orders

Thoughts: The user asked for the total payment amount of the last 5 non-cancelled orders. The agent's action history ends with it telling the user "I don't see any orders..." and offering options, but the last page snapshot clearly shows an Orders grid with "308 records found" and visible orders (e.g. IDs 000000299 $219.40, 000000065 $210.00).
