## Intent

Post my question, "what is the SOTA web navigation agent repo", in a subreddit where I'm likely to get an answer

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent was to post the question to a subreddit. The action history shows the agent navigated to the Create submission page, filled the title and body, attempted submission, and the final page (screenshot) displays the red error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The agent did not successfully submit the post and only reported the rate-limit and offered next-step options. Therefore the posting task was not completed.  
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I tried to submit your question but the page displays: “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.” It looks like your account is rate-limited or otherwise blocked from posting right now. What would you like me to do next?\n\nOptions:\n1

===============INFO - Memory 1 (ZIP code phrasing) is irrelevant to this task, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (about ZIP code phrasing) — it's irrelevant. I will not use Memory 2 (answer factual queries immediately) — the user wants me to post a question, not provide a factual answer. I will not use Memory 3 (open canonical post for author link) — not relevant for creating a new submission.
