Thoughts: The agent located the reviews for "Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket" and listed the two customers with negative feedback (Emma, ID 351, and seam miller, ID 349) with matching titles, snippets, statuses, and product—consistent with the page snapshot. The agent also correctly omitted Jane Smith (ID 347) who left a positive review and offered sensible follow-ups. This satisfies the user's information-seeking intent.
