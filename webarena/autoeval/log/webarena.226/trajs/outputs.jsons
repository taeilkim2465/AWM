{"id": 226, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the price range of AmazonBasics products. The agent searched for \"AmazonBasics\", observed 4 items on the results page, extracted and reported the minimum and maximum prices seen ($16.06\u2013$53.99), itemized the visible prices, and explicitly noted the range only reflects the current page while offering to scan more pages. That satisfies the information-seeking task requirements (provides the requested information and notes scope).", "status": "success"}}
