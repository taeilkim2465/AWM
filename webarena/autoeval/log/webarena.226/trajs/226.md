What is the price range for products from Amazon basic?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the price range of AmazonBasics products. The agent searched for "AmazonBasics", observed 4 items on the results page, extracted and reported the minimum and maximum prices seen ($16.06–$53.99), itemized the visible prices, and explicitly noted the range only reflects the current page while offering to scan more pages. That satisfies the information-seeking task requirements (provides the requested information and notes scope). 
Status: "success"
