Find the page of the undergrad college of the person who developed the Nash equilibrium on the map.

Thoughts: The agent searched for "Carnegie Mellon University" (the undergraduate college associated with John Nash) and the page shows search results listing Carnegie Mellon University with the map centered on its campus. The requested college page on the map was located in the results, so the navigation task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"
