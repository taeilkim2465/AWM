The agent only provided a generic SSH clone template and offered follow-up options (including recommending a GAN repo), but it did not give a concrete repository name or actual SSH clone command for a specific GAN implementation nor state that such info was unavailable. For an information-seeking task this is insufficient and thus fails to meet the user's request.", "status": "failure"}}
