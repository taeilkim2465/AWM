## Intent

Disable Teton pullover hoodie from the site, they are facing some quality issues.

## RM

Thoughts: The product edit page for "Teton Pullover Hoodie" is open and the "Enable Product" toggle is set to "No" in the final snapshot, and the action history shows a final click that corresponds to the Save area. The agent therefore disabled the product (and appears to have saved the change), meeting the user's intent to disable the item due to quality issues.
Status: "success"
