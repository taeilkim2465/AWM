## Intent

How many commits did Nic make in April 2021?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for "Nic" and scrolled but the final page snapshot only shows commits from August and July 2021 — no April 2021 commits or a total count for Nic are visible. Because the requested information (number of commits by Nic in April 2021) is not presented or explicitly stated as unavailable, the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 and Memory 3 because they are relevant to accurately counting commits by date and confirming the author for each commit. Memory 1 is not relevant (it's about reporting review sentiment). I'll open the commits list by clicking the "2,320 Commits" link so I can filter or inspect commits and then verify individual commit details to confirm author and timestamp (per Memory 3). After the commits page loads I'll look for filtering by author and date, and if needed open individual commits from April 2021 to confirm and count them.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Provide sampling context): I will not use this — it's about reporting context for extracted sentences, not relevant to counting commits.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (reporting how many sources inspected) is not relevant for counting commits, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Provide sampling context) is not needed for this step — I just need to find commits, not report sampled sentences.
