## Intent

How many commits did kilian make to a11yproject on 3/5/2023?

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot shows "05 Mar, 2023 1 commit" and the single listed commit on that date is "Fix typos in the code examples (#1524)" authored by Kilian Valkhof. The agent reported exactly that (1 commit with that message), so the answer is correct.
Status: "success"

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about checking navigation badges to infer counts, but the project list already shows project entries and no badge indicating per-user commit counts for the date; it won't answer the exact commits-by-kilian-on-3/5/2023 question.
===============INFO - Memory 1-3 (about checking navigation badges) are not needed here — they suggest checking sidebar counts to infer list sizes, but I need to inspect the commit history itself to count commits by a specific author on a specific date. So I will not use those memories.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check navigation badges before loading full lists): I will not use this — the commits list for March 2023 is already visible on the page, so checking badges isn't necessary.
