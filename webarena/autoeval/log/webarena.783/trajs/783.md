## Intent

Add the following users to repo kkroening/ffmpeg-python as maintainer: ['yjlou', 'a11yproject']

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched this GitLab instance for kkroening/ffmpeg-python and the page shows "We couldn't find any projects matching kkroening/ffmpeg-python." The agent did not add the users and instead asked the user to confirm the project location and to provide access/permissions. Because the requested content modification (adding yjlou and a11yproject as Maintainers) was not completed and the agent requested further input/permissions, the task is not finished.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I couldn't find kkroening/ffmpeg-python on this GitLab instance. Do you mean the project on gitlab.com (https://gitlab.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python
