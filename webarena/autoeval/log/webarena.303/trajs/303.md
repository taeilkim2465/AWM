## Intent

How many commits did Kilian make durning 2023?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent attempted to filter commits by author (searching for "Kilian Valkhof"), but the final page still shows commits by other authors (Eric Bailey, Cooper Hollmaier) and the author dropdown is open with the query rather than showing a filtered results count. There's no visible total of Kilian's commits for 2023 and the filter does not appear to be applied, so the agent did not obtain the requested count. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (confirming date format) because when I count commits from 2023 I need to ensure the site displays dates in a clear format (day/month/year vs month/day/year) so I match commits to the correct year. I will also use Memory 3 (check navigation badges) — the page already shows a commits badge (2,320) which confirms where the commits list is; clicking that should open the commits list so I can filter/count Kilian's commits. I will not use Memory 1 (reporting review context) because it's not relevant to counting commits.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Provide sampling context..." — Not relevant for this step (we're counting commits, not extracting sentences), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Provide sampling context) is not relevant for this step — the user only asked for a count, not extracted sentences or sentiment, so I won't use it.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Provide sampling context) — Not relevant for this task (we're counting commits), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (reporting how many sources inspected) is not relevant for counting commits, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (provide sampling context) is not useful for this step — I only need to filter and count commits, not report review sampling.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Provide sampling context) is not needed right now — I'm just filtering commits and counting, not extracting review sentences.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Provide sampling context..." — I will not use this. It's about reporting review counts for extracted sentences, which is irrelevant to counting commits.
