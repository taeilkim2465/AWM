## Intent

Post a notice on a virtual meetup for Tears of Kingdom enthusiasts on Dec 15th in the games subreddit

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the subreddit, title, and body and attempted to submit, but the page shows the red error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The agent informed the user of the restriction and offered next-step options, but did not successfully post the meetup notice. Because the content was not submitted/published, the task (post the notice) was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I can’t submit the post right now. The page shows a posting restriction: “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.”\n\nCurrent submission (ready but blocked

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Detect and interpret posting-restriction notices" — I will use this. After attempting to submit I should watch for any visible error or notice banners and stop if one appears, so I'll check for them after opening the submit form and after attempting to post.
===============INFO - I will use all three memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Detect and interpret posting-restriction notices): I will not actively use it before submitting, but I will keep it in mind after submission in case an error banner appears.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It directly applies — the page shows a visible notice that looks like a posting restriction. I should capture and report it instead of retrying.
