## Intent

Tell me the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Posner Hall

## RM

Thoughts: The agent repeatedly submitted search queries for Posner Hall and for "restaurants near..." but the final page only shows a global map with no search results or list of nearby restaurants visible. The agent did not return the requested restaurant information nor explicitly state that it was unavailable, so the information-seeking task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use the OpenStreetMap search box to find Posner Hall at Carnegie Mellon University and then look for nearby restaurants.
===============INFO - I will decide whether to use the memory items first:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will not use this. It's a template about reply instructions and isn't needed to find restaurants.
===============INFO - I'll consider the three memory items and decide whether to use them:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll consider the three memory items before acting.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Include explicit reply instructions..." — I will NOT use this memory item right now; it's not needed for finding nearby restaurants, though I may use it later when presenting choices to the user.
