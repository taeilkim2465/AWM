## Intent

Disable Karmen yoga pants from the site, they are facing some quality issues.

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted the "Karmen Yoga Pant" disabled. The action sequence includes focusing and pressing Space on the Enable Product control (steps 7–8) and subsequent clicks (steps 6 and 10) that correspond to interacting with the page (likely saving). The final page snapshot clearly shows "Enable Product" set to "No" for Karmen Yoga Pant, indicating the product is disabled in the UI. Therefore the agent achieved the requested change.
Status: "success"
