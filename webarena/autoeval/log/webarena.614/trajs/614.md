## Intent

Post a review of my recent reading "Gone with the wind" in the r/books with my comment "It's a book with history".

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the Title and Body correctly and attempted to submit (actions 3-7). The final page snapshot clearly shows the red error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." and the form still contains the text, so the post was not created. Although the agent informed the user of the error and offered next steps, it did not complete the requested post action due to the site restriction.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I filled the form for r/books (Title: 'Gone with the wind', Body: \"It's a book with history\"

User Intent: Post a review of my recent reading "Gone with the wind" in the r/books with my comment "It's a book with history".

Action History:

4: fill('142', "It's a book with history")
5: click('427')
6: click('400')
7: click('407')
8: send_msg_to_user("I filled the form for r/books (Title: 'Gone with the wind', Body: \"It's a book with history\") and tried to submit, but the site shows: 'You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.' I can’t post right now because of that restriction. Would you like me to: (1) wait and try again in a bit, (2) save/export the post text so you can submit it later, (3) post to a different subreddit/community now, or (4) edit the title/body before retrying?")
