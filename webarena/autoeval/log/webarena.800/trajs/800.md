## Intent

create a new group "x-lab" with members JonasVautherin, dilipchandima, dawiss1337, bmyun, DCMJY

## RM

Thoughts: The x-lab group itself appears to have been created (sidebar shows x-lab / Members page), but the invite dialog shows the usernames entered produce "No matches found" and a red error "Please add members to invite" with the Invite button disabled. The listed members were not successfully added/invited, so the user's full intent (create group and add those members) was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory item 1: "Confirm entity creation completed before performing follow-up actions" — I will use this. After creating the group I must wait for a success confirmation or the new group page to appear before adding members.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm entity creation completed before performing follow-up actions" — I will use this. After creating the group, I should wait for a clear success indicator before adding members.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 later in the flow to verify creation succeeded and to check existing members before inviting to avoid duplicate invites. Memory 3 is about project creation/visibility and is not relevant for creating a group, so I will not use it now.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 3 now because they remind me to verify creation completes before adding members and to ensure the group exists and visibility is set correctly. Memory 2 (check current members/pending invites) is useful later when inviting members, but not yet because the group doesn't exist yet.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm entity creation completed before performing follow-up actions" — I will use this. The page already shows the success alert "Group x-lab was successfully created." I should still ensure the UI is on the group page and stable before adding members.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm entity creation completed before performing follow-up actions): I will use this. The group "x-lab" appears in the sidebar and the page title shows "x-lab · Activity", so I'll verify the group's members page is loaded before inviting anyone.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to confirm the group exists before adding members. I can see "You're viewing members of x-lab" and the member list, so the group creation is confirmed; I'll proceed to invite members.
===============INFO - Memory check:
