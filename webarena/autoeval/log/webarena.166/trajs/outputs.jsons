The provided page snapshot of the 4 reviews shows review snippets (\"like it.\", \"Perfect!!\", \"It was received as expected.\", and a \"Good Taste\" heading) but does not show the quoted sentence the agent extracted. Because the extracted sentence does not appear in the visible reviews and the agent did not correctly extract criticism sentences that are actually present (or correctly report none), the information-seeking task was not completed successfully.", "status": "failure"}}
