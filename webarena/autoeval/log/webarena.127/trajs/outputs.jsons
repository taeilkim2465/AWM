{"id": 127, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent was to know which brands appear most frequently among the top search terms. The agent provided the top search terms with counts, identified \"hollister\" as the only clearly identifiable brand and noted it appears most frequently (19 uses), and offered next steps for a true brand-level aggregation. That directly answers the user's question and either gives the info requested or explains how to obtain a more detailed brand roll-up. The dashboard snapshot does not contradict this.", "status": "success"}}
