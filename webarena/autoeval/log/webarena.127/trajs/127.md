## Intent

What brands appear most frequently among the top search terms?

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent was to know which brands appear most frequently among the top search terms. The agent provided the top search terms with counts, identified "hollister" as the only clearly identifiable brand and noted it appears most frequently (19 uses), and offered next steps for a true brand-level aggregation. That directly answers the user's question and either gives the info requested or explains how to obtain a more detailed brand roll-up. The dashboard snapshot does not contradict this. 
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (use site's search box): Not needed — the Top Search Terms table is visible on the dashboard and already contains the terms and use counts we need.

Action History:
1: send_msg_to_user("Top Search Terms shown on the dashboard (with Uses):\\n- hollister — 19 uses\\n- Joust Bag — 4 uses\\n- Antonia Racer Tank — 2 uses\\n- tanks — 1 use\\n- WP10 — 1 use\\n\\nOf these, hollister is the only clearly identifiable brand and it appears most frequently (19 uses). The others look like product names (Joust Bag, Antonia Racer Tank), a generic term (tanks), or an unknown code (WP10). If you want a true brand-level aggregation (to roll up product-level terms into brands), I can attempt to map search terms to product brands or run searches for each brand using the site search to get counts.")
