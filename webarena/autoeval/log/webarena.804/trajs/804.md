## Intent

Assign the issue regarding flash alerts to myself and primer.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent used the quick action '/assign @byteblaze @primer' (action 7), but the page shows "Assigned @primer." in the banner and the Assignee sidebar lists only Primer. Activity entries show assignments toggling, but the final state has only @primer assigned, not both @byteblaze and @primer. Therefore the requested assignment to both myself and primer was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll navigate into the "Primer / design" project to find the issue about "flash alerts" and assign it.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use filtered/assigned list view): Not needed — the target issue "Clarify usage of flash alert" is visible in the current list, so filtering is unnecessary.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use filtered/assigned list view to locate issues by assignee): I will not use this memory right now — we already have the specific issue open, so filters aren't needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use filtered/assigned list view to locate issues by assignee): I will not use this memory now — we already have the issue open and the assignee control visible, so filtering the issue list isn't needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use filtered/assigned list view): Not needed — we're already on the specific issue detail page, so filtering the list isn't useful for assigning this single issue.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use filtered/assigned list view): NOT using — it's for locating issues in lists by assignee; we're already on the issue detail and need to change assignees directly.
===============INFO - I will use the issue details assignee control to add myself (Byte Blaze) alongside Primer.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filtered/assigned list view): Not needed — we already have the issue open and can edit assignees from the issue details, so we won't use this.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 because it directly recommends assigning users from the issue details sidebar, which is exactly where the assignee control is open now.
