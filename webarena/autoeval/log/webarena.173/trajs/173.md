## Intent

Open my latest updated issue that has keyword "better" in its title to check if it is closed

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened the issue titled "Better initial load experience" (visible in the screenshot) which contains the keyword "better" and clearly shows the green "Open" status badge and a "Close issue" button. The assistant's message correctly reports the issue is open and not closed. This satisfies the user's request to open the latest updated issue with "better" in the title and check whether it is closed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I opened the issue titled 'Better initial load experience' (issue #8
