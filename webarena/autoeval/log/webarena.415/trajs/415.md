## Intent

Go to the merge request on verification functions I have to review, find if the author of the merge request responded at the end, and reply "Thank you" if he did. Otherwise remind him with a simple @.

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the most recent comment is by Byte Blaze containing just "@" (the agent's posted reminder). There is no author reply at the end (the author noted earlier in the activity is not the last commenter). The user's instruction was to reply "Thank you" only if the author responded at the end, otherwise remind with a simple "@". The agent posted "@" as required, so the content modification task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It says to find the target MR from the project's Merge Requests list — I'm already on that page and the MR titled "Add verification functions" is visible, so this applies.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use the project's Merge Requests list) — Not needed: we're already on the specific merge request page for "!40", so we don't need to open the MR list again.
