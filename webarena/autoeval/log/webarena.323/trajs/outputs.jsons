{"id": 323, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent correctly read the order totals (Subtotal $186.59, Shipping $20.00 nonrefundable) and identified the four item prices on the page. It calculated the refund for each possible line-item retained (subtracting the kept item's price from the subtotal) and clearly explained the shipping nonrefundable rule and the effect of payment method, then asked the user to confirm which SKU/item is the AC\u2011DC adapter so it can give the exact refund. The snapshot only shows one product (a sandal at $101.90) and not the adapter, so the agent could not unambiguously pick the correct line item. Given it provided the needed calculations and a clear request for the one missing piece of info, the execution met the information-seeking requirement.", "status": "success"}}
