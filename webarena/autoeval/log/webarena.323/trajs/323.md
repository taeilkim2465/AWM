## Intent

How much refund I should expect from my order canlled in 2022/03? I only kept the AC-DC Adapter and the shop told me that I cannot get the shipping fee back

## RM

Thoughts: The agent correctly read the order totals (Subtotal $186.59, Shipping $20.00 nonrefundable) and identified the four item prices on the page. It calculated the refund for each possible line-item retained (subtracting the kept item's price from the subtotal) and clearly explained the shipping nonrefundable rule and the effect of payment method, then asked the user to confirm which SKU/item is the AC‑DC adapter so it can give the exact refund. The snapshot only shows one product (a sandal at $101.90) and not the adapter, so the agent could not unambiguously pick the correct line item. Given it provided the needed calculations and a clear request for the one missing piece of info, the execution met the information-seeking requirement.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I can calculate this precisely — I just need to know which line item is the AC‑DC adapter. On the order page I can see four item prices: $101.90, $43.59, $15.11, and $25.99. The order totals are: Subtotal $186.59, Shipping & Handling $20.00 (nonrefundable

The order totals are: Subtotal $186.59, Shipping & Handling $20.00 (nonrefundable), Grand Total $206.59. Because shipping is nonrefundable, the refund = subtotal ($186.59) minus the price of the item you kept. Here are the possible refunds depending on which price matches the adapter:\n\n- If adapter = $101.90 → refund = $186.59 − $101.90 = $84.69\n- If adapter = $43.59 → refund = $186.59 − $43.59 = $143.00\n- If adapter = $15.11 → refund = $186.59 − $15.11 = $171.48\n- If adapter = $25.99 → refund = $186.59 − $25.99 = $160.60\n\nNote: Payment method on the order is \"Check / Money order,\" which may affect refund timing or method. Tell me which item (or SKU) is the AC‑DC adapter and I’ll give the exact refund amount and next steps.")
