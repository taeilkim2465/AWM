## Intent

We've received 378 brown Aero daily fitness tee in every size, please update the inventory.

## RM

Thoughts: The task is a content modification request (update inventory). The action history shows only clicks on product variants, and the final page snapshot still shows Quantity = 100 for the brown variants (and others). There is no evidence the quantities were changed to 378 or that a Save was performed. Therefore the inventory was not updated as requested.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (operate at variant/ SKU level): I will use this — the page I'm on is a specific variant (Aero Daily Fitness Tee-XS-Brown), so updates must be done per variant/SKU rather than at the parent product level.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (operate at variant/SKU level): I will use this — the product is configurable and inventory is tracked per variant, so I must edit each brown variant/SKU individually.
