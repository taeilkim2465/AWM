Action History:
1: send_msg_to_user("Here’s the concise SSH clone form you can reuse:\n\n- Template: git clone <SSH-URL>\n- SSH URL pattern (example): git@gitlab.com:namespace/repo.git\n\nSo if the repo’s SSH URL were git@gitlab.com:owner/covid-location-tracker.git, the command would be:\n\n    git clone git@gitlab.com:owner/covid-location-tracker.git\n\nWhat would you like me to do next?\n- Search this GitLab instance for “covid location tracker” and open the top (most-starred) result\n- Show the HTTPS clone command instead\n- Help add an SSH key to your account (required for push/pull)\n- Or tell me the exact namespace/repo and I’ll open it and give the real SSH URL")
