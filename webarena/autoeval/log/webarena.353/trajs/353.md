## Intent

List products from competitive swimwear category by ascending price

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the Competitive Swimwear category filter, sorted results by Price, and extracted the 12 visible products from page 1 in ascending price order, including prices and flags for potentially ambiguous items. It also noted there are 51 results total and offered to continue or extract all pages. This satisfies the information-seeking goal (it returned the requested list and clearly indicated scope and next steps), so the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I extracted the products visible on page 1 (sorted by price ascending

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they remind me to confirm category and visible price on product listing cards before including items in results. I will not use Memory 2 because it applies to order detail pages and computing discounted prices, which is not relevant right now.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories that help ensure I only list items that clearly match the category and have visible prices.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify category and price from visible metadata): I will use this — it's important to confirm each product's title/category and displayed price before listing them.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify category and price from visible metadata): I will use this — I need to confirm each product is in the competitive/swimwear category and has a visible price before listing it.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items that instruct me to verify category and price from listing metadata so the results are accurate.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they tell me to verify category and visible prices on listing cards before including items in the results. I will not use Memory 2 because it applies to order detail pages and computing discounted prices, which is not relevant now.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they tell me to verify each product's title and displayed price on the listing page before including it — this is exactly what I can do with the visible results. I will not use Memory 2 because it refers to order detail pages and computing discounted prices, which is not relevant here.
