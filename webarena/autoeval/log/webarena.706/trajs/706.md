## Intent

Today is 3/15/2023, generate a refund report for Q1

## RM

Thoughts: The agent set the Period to "Month" and filled the From (1/1/23) and To (3/31/23) fields, then clicked the Show Report control (action 6). However the final page snapshot still only shows the filter form and no generated report data or results section visible, so there is no evidence the refund report for Q1 was produced. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I'll use the provided memories to guide the next steps:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it guides how to present refund scenarios and which order-level fields to collect if needed (order id, dates, subtotals, shipping, taxes, grand total). This is relevant for building a clear refund report.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (Confirm report filters are set and the report is executed) because it directly applies: I need to set the period/granularity and the From/To dates and run the report.
