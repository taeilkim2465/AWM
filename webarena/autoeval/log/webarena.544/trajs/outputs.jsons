The action history shows only clicks (no explicit edit of a description field or insertion of quoted comments), and the final snapshot is the product edit page showing product name, SKU, price, etc., but no edited description or visible quoted review text. There's no evidence the description was changed or saved with quoted comments. Therefore the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
