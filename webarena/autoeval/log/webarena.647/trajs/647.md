## Intent

Post in technology forum about what could open-source LLMs help the correpong field.

## RM

Thoughts: The user intended to post in the technology forum. The action history shows the title/body filled, the Technology category selected, and submit actions. The final page snapshot displays the new post with the correct title, content, and "submitted ... in technology," so the post was successfully created and visible.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (Compose community posts) because it reminds me to prepare a clear, concise title and a detailed body with context and prompts — this will help craft the post once the submission form is open. I will use Memory 3 (Skip irrelevant tools) to avoid unnecessary navigation and go directly to the Submit form. I will not use Memory 1 (slug/internal identifier) because we're not creating a new forum, just posting in an existing forum.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 (compose community posts for maximum response quality) to craft a clear title and a detailed body with prompts to encourage responses. I will use Memory 3 (skip irrelevant tools) to focus on the submission form and not navigate elsewhere. I will not use Memory 1 because that's about creating a forum (we're only creating a submission/post in an existing forum).
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Populate both the internal identifier (slug) and the visible title when creating a forum" — Not relevant for this step (we're posting in an existing forum), so I will not use it.

User Intent: Post in technology forum about what could open-source LLMs help the correpong field.

Action History:
1: click('63')
2: fill('137', 'How can open-source LLMs help real-world workflows and projects?')
3: fill('142', "I'm researching practical ways open-source large language models (LLMs) can help different fields and everyday workflows. Looking for concrete examples, pros/cons, and real-world experiences.\n\nQuestions to consider:\n- What specific tasks or workflows have you improved with open-source LLMs (e.g., code generation, document summarization, data analysis, customer support, automation)?\n- Which open-source models and toolkits worked best for you, and why?\n- What were the main challenges (deployment, inference cost, fine-tuning, data privacy, latency, model maintenance)?\n- How did you handle licensing, safety, and governance concerns in production?\n- Any recommended platforms, libraries, or strategies for teams starting to adopt open-source LLMs?\n\nPlease share short examples, references, or lessons learned — I'm especially interested in tangible outcomes (time saved, accuracy improvements, costs). Thanks!")
