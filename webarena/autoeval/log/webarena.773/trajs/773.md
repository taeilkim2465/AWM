## Intent

Delete all pending negative reviews

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a success message "A total of 2 record(s) have been deleted," but the grid still lists 1 pending review (ID 349) with a negative comment. The user's intent was to delete all pending negative reviews; since at least one pending negative review remains visible, the task is not complete. 
Status: "failure"
