## Intent

Pull up the description page of Carnegie Music Hall on Map

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows the search results panel for "Carnegie Music Hall" (a result entry with address), but it does not show the individual place/description page (no details page for Carnegie Music Hall was opened). The action history indicates only the search was submitted; the specific result link was not opened. Therefore the agent did not navigate to the description page requested.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it reminds me to click the specific search result or marker to open the place description if the search doesn't directly open it. I'll not use Memory 2 because the user already specified the exact venue name "Carnegie Music Hall" so no translation is needed. I'll keep Memory 3 in mind as a fallback (constructing a site search URL or clicking the marker/result link) if the normal search UI doesn't open the description page.
