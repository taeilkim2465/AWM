## Intent

Draft a refund message via their "contact us" form for the PS3 remote controller I bought early 2023. It broke after three days of use. The shop requires the order id, the reason and the amount to refund in the message. Don't submit yet

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to draft (but not submit) a refund message including order id, reason, and refund amount. Although the agent performed many fill actions with full draft text, the final page snapshot shows the "What's on your mind?" textarea only contains a short signature ("Thank you, Emma Lopez emma.lopez@gmail.com Phone: [PHONE NUMBER]") and the order ID, item, purchase date, requested amount, and reason are missing. Because the required information is not present in the final form state, the task was not completed successfully.  
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the memory items because they remind me to include the required identifiers, a clear reason, and to offer evidence and return instructions — all of which the shop requires or which will speed processing.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Include required identifiers and the exact refund amount — I will use this. The shop requires order ID and refund amount; since the user hasn't provided them, I'll keep clear placeholders [ORDER ID] and [AMOUNT] at the top so they are easy to replace.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to make the message clear and complete:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It reminds me to put required identifiers (order ID, item) and the exact refund amount near the top of the message so the shop can locate the order quickly.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they remind me to include required identifiers, the exact refund amount, a clear reason and timeline, and to offer evidence and ask about returns — all are relevant to drafting the message.
