## Intent

Show me the path and travel time from home of the 1980 Super Bowl champions to home of the 1991 Super Bowl champions.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the path and travel time between the homes of the 1980 and 1991 Super Bowl champions. The agent mapped the teams to Pittsburgh, PA (Steelers) and East Rutherford, NJ (Giants), plotted a driving route, and reported Distance: 629 km and Time: 7 hr 19 min. The final page snapshot shows the route and the same distance/time in the Directions panel, and the team→city mapping used is correct. The agent provided the requested information and the map, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I used the team→city mapping from memory. I plotted a driving route from Pittsburgh, PA (home of the 1980 Super Bowl champions, the Pittsburgh Steelers
