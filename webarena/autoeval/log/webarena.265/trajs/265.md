## Intent

What's the closest national park to Boston? How far is it to drive there?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent returned a clear, relevant answer: it distinguished between "National Park" designation vs any NPS unit, named the closest NPS unit in Boston (Boston National Historical Park — essentially no drive), gave a nearby NPS unit (Minute Man NHP ~20 miles, ~30–40 min), and supplied the nearest national park by designation (Acadia — ~280 miles, ~4.5–5 hours). It also offered to compute exact driving directions/time. Although the OpenStreetMap search pane shows "No results found," the agent still provided the requested information and a reasonable offer for precise routing, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I'll center the map on Boston so I can then look up nearby national parks and get driving directions. I'll fill the search box with "Boston Common" and press the Go button to locate Boston on the map.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1, 2, or 3 because they refer to preferring specific in-page navigation for lists or tasks; this query is about finding the nearest national park to Boston and driving distance, which is best handled by searching for "national park near Boston" rather than clicking navigation elements or list pages.
