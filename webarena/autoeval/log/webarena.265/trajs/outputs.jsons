{"id": 265, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This is an information-seeking task. The agent returned a clear, relevant answer: it distinguished between \"National Park\" designation vs any NPS unit, named the closest NPS unit in Boston (Boston National Historical Park \u2014 essentially no drive), gave a nearby NPS unit (Minute Man NHP ~20 miles, ~30\u201340 min), and supplied the nearest national park by designation (Acadia \u2014 ~280 miles, ~4.5\u20135 hours). It also offered to compute exact driving directions/time. Although the OpenStreetMap search pane shows \"No results found,\" the agent still provided the requested information and a reasonable offer for precise routing, so the task is completed successfully.", "status": "success"}}
