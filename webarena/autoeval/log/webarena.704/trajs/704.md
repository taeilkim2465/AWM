## Intent

Today is 3/15/2023, generate a sales order report for last month

## RM

Thoughts: The agent correctly set Period = Month and entered From = 02/01/2023 and To = 02/28/2023 (which matches "last month" for 3/15/2023) and then clicked the report button. However the final page snapshot still only shows the filter controls (Period, From, To) and no generated report results or a message saying no data is available. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to return the report data or explicitly state it's unavailable; there is no evidence the report was produced. 
Status: "failure"
