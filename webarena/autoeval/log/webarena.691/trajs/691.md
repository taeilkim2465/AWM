===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to shape a concise, polite coupon/loyalty request that includes the sender's name and contact details and states the intention to buy in bulk. I'll use Memory 2 as a reminder not to expose any email from the site without permission; I won't surface any site emails in the chat. I will not use Memory 3 right now because I'm not trying to find a reviewer's email — my next step is to open the site's Contact Us form so I can draft and send the message through it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compose a concise, polite coupon/loyalty request with contact details): I will use this — it tells me to keep the message brief, include the sender’s name and contact details, and politely request a coupon/discount. The form already has name and email filled, so I'll include those in the message and keep it concise.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (compose concise, polite request): YES — I'll use this as guidance to keep the message brief, include your name and contact, and politely request a coupon/bulk discount.
