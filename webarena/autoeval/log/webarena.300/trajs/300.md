## Intent

Show the most recent pending order

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to show the most recent pending order. The agent clicked (action 1) but the final page snapshot shows the My Account overview (not an orders list or order details), so there is no visible pending order information. The agent then sent an order number (000000189) without the page displaying or confirming that order — the required information is not actually shown on the page. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'The most recent pending order number is 000000189.'

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — the Recent Orders table is visible on the page so I can read the orders directly; no need to consult stored memories.
