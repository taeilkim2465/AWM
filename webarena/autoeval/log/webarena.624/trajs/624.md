## Intent

Ask for advice about break-up remedy in a subreddit for relations

## RM

Thoughts: The agent reached the submission page (Create submission) and appropriately asked the user clarifying questions (personal details vs anonymous, what help they want, and confirmation to post in "Relationships") before drafting the post. No errors shown and the agent's next step (drafting the title/body after user answers) is reasonable, so the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Clarify context and medical history): Not directly relevant — this is emotional/relationship advice, not a medical symptom. I won't use it now, though I will ask a few contextual questions to tailor the post.
