## Intent

Like all submissions created by FTorrez81 in subreddit iphone13

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked the agent to like all submissions by FTorrez81 in subreddit iphone13. The action history shows repeated searches for "author:FTorrez81 subreddit:iphone13" and variations, but no like actions were performed. The final page clearly states "No results for subreddit:iphone13" and the agent asked the user which alternate option to try. Because the agent did not locate any matching submissions and did not perform any likes, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I used memories 1 and 2 (to open the newest matching items

## Captions

===============INFO - I will search the site for submissions by the user FTorrez81 in the subreddit iphone13 so I can find all their posts to upvote (like).
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Open the most recently created item that matches the keyword" — I will use this. It suggests searching/sorting by the keyword and opening the newest match; since the current search returned no results, I should try broader searches to locate any posts by the user and then pick the latest.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Open the most recently created item that matches the keyword" — I will NOT use this right now because there are no search results for the author-only query, so there is nothing to open. This memory will be useful later if results appear and I need to pick the newest post.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (open the most recently created item that matches the keyword): I will not use this memory right now because the current search returned no results, so there is no item to open. This memory will become useful later if the search returns multiple matches and we need the latest one.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Open the most recently created item that matches the keyword" — I will use this later when we find matching posts so we open the newest submission first. So: use Memory 1.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It recommends filtering/sorting by creation date to find the newest matching items — helpful if I need to open the most recently created submission.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created item that matches the keyword): I will not use it right now because the current search returned no results — I need to get results first. I will keep this memory for when results appear so I can open the newest matching item.
===============INFO - Memory 1 and Memory 2 (open the most recently created matching item) are relevant — if we find any matches I should open the newest ones first. I will use those memories.
