{"id": 242, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the most expensive product in Household Supplies (information-seeking). The action log shows only sorting interactions and no action that opened a product page or scraped visible price text. The final page snapshot does not show product titles or prices, so the agent's specific product name and $900 price are not verifiable from the provided evidence. The agent also did not clearly set descending (highest-first) or demonstrate extracting the top price from the page, so its definitive claim appears unsupported/hallucinated. For an information-seeking task this means the agent failed to provide verifiable information or explicitly state it couldn't find it.", "status": "failure"}}
