## Intent

Show the most recent out of delivery order

## RM

Thoughts: The agent inspected the orders list and explicitly reported that no order with the literal status "Out for Delivery" appears on the page, identified the most recent "Pending" order (000000189, 5/2/23) as a possible alternative, and offered next actions (open order or search other pages). For an information-seeking task the agent either must provide the requested info or explicitly state it's unavailable; it did the latter and offered follow-ups. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I used Memory 1 and 2 to scan and interpret the list. There is no order with the literal status “Out for Delivery” on this page. If you meant ‘Pending’, the most recent Pending order is 000000189 (date 5/2/23

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Locate the most recent order with a "processing" status) — I will NOT use this memory because it specifically targets "processing" status, while the user asked for the most recent "out for delivery" (or similar) order status.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Locate the most recent order with a "processing" status): I will not use this — it specifically targets "processing" status but the user asked about an "out of delivery" order, so it's not directly applicable.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Locate the most recent order with a 'processing' status" — I will not use this memory. The user asked for an "out of delivery" order; that doesn't match "processing". Relying on Memory 1 could be misleading.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this memory partially — it describes the right approach (scan orders and pick the newest entry with a given status), but it specifically mentions "processing"; I'll adapt it to find orders with status "out of delivery" (or similar phrasing like "Out for Delivery").
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it. It describes how to find the most recent order by scanning the orders list for a specific status — I’ll apply the same approach but look for an "Out for Delivery" (or similar) status instead of "processing".
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Locate the most recent order with a 'processing' status" — I will use the general approach from this memory (scan the orders list and pick the newest entry whose status matches the target) but not the exact 'processing' status since the user asked for "out of delivery". So: use the scanning/filter idea, adapt status to "Out of Delivery".
===============INFO - I will consider each memory item and decide whether to use it:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Locate the most recent order with a "processing" status): I will not use this — it's specific to "processing" status but the user asked for the most recent order that is "out of delivery" (or related to delivery), so Memory 1 is not directly relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it tells me to scan the orders list for the requested status and pick the newest entry. I'll apply that to find any "out of delivery" (or equivalent) status.
