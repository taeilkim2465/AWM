The action history shows the origin/destination were entered and \"Foot (OSRM)\" selected, but the final page snapshot still shows the directions input pane with the \"Go\" button visible and no route, no travel time, and the map is zoomed out over upstate New York (not centered on Pittsburgh/CMU). Repeated clicks/Enter did not produce a displayed route or travel-time result. Because the page does not show the walking duration or an explicit statement that the info is unavailable, the agent did not provide the requested information.", "status": "failure"}}
