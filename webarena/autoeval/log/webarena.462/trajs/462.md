## Intent

Increase the price of this product by 10%

## RM

Thoughts: The agent cleared the price field (action 2), filled it with 19.80 (action 3), and clicked the Save button (action 4). The final page snapshot shows the Price field set to $19.80. That is a 10% increase from the original $18.00 (18.00 * 1.10 = 19.80), and the change was saved—so the requested update was applied successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it's about extracting product prices from order details, which doesn't help for editing the product price here. I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify product-level metadata...) — I will NOT use this. It's about extracting and sorting prices from order details, which is not needed for simply updating this product's price.
