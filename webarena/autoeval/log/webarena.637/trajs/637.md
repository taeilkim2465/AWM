## Intent

Post in the most appropriate subreddit and ask for recommendations for sony headphones products within a budget of $500

## RM

Thoughts: The agent prepared the submission (selected r/headphones, filled title and body) and attempted to post, but the final page clearly shows the error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The agent informed the user of the failure and offered next-step options, but it did not successfully submit the post, so the requested posting action was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I prepared a post for r/headphones but the site shows "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again", so I cannot submit right now.\n\nI used Memory 2 and 3 (kept the concise user details and chose the headphones community

===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows before taking action:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm budget and recipient preferences" — I will partially use this. The user already specified the $500 budget, so I won't ask the user for the budget again, but I will include a short prompt in the post asking respondents to request any missing preferences (e.g., wired vs wireless, ANC vs open) if they need clarification.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm budget and recipient preferences" — I will NOT use this. The user already gave a clear budget ($500) and stated priorities in their instruction and the post body, so no further confirmation is needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm budget and recipient preferences): I will not use this — the user already gave a clear $500 budget and priorities in their request, so asking again would slow things down unless the user wants to refine recipient/use details.
