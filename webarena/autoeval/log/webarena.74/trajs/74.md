## Intent

Given the following locations, ['Carnegie Mellon University', 'apple store shadyside', 'starbucks on craig street'], what would be the optimal route to travel through them all in order to minimize total travel time? Please note the journey begins at the first place listed.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the optimal route visiting all three places (starting at Carnegie Mellon) to minimize total travel time. The action history and final page show the agent only computed directions from Carnegie Mellon University to the Apple Store (single destination) and never produced or compared a multi-stop itinerary including Starbucks (no multi-leg route or comparison of orders). The required information — an optimal visiting order and total travel time for that route — is therefore missing. 
Status: "failure"
