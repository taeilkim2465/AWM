## Intent

Tell me when I last ordered my toothpaste?

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows Recent Orders and a Recently Ordered list, but none of the visible items are toothpaste and the order rows only show order numbers, dates and totals (no item-level details). The action history does not include clicking any "View Order" links to inspect the contents of individual orders, so there is no evidence the agent checked order details to find a toothpaste purchase. Because the page snapshot does not show any toothpaste order and the agent did not open orders to confirm, it did not answer when the user last ordered toothpaste.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Include explicit reply instructions): I will not use this — it is a general instruction template and not needed to find order history.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will check the stored memory items first:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (explicit reply instructions): I will not use this — it's a template about reply formatting, not needed to find the order.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (explicit reply instructions): I will not use this — it's a meta instruction about how to phrase replies, not needed to find order data.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (explicit reply instructions) — I will not use this; it's not helpful for finding the toothpaste order.
===============INFO - I'll only use Memory 3 (Check for newer cancelled orders relative to latest active order) because when I report the "most recent" toothpaste order I should verify whether any newer orders were cancelled — that could affect which order counts as the last successful order. I will not use Memory 1 or Memory 2 because they aren't needed for this lookup.
