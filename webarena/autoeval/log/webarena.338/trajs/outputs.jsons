{"id": 338, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The final page shows Recent Orders and a Recently Ordered list, but none of the visible items are toothpaste and the order rows only show order numbers, dates and totals (no item-level details). The action history does not include clicking any \"View Order\" links to inspect the contents of individual orders, so there is no evidence the agent checked order details to find a toothpaste purchase. Because the page snapshot does not show any toothpaste order and the agent did not open orders to confirm, it did not answer when the user last ordered toothpaste.", "status": "failure"}}
