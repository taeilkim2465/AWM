## Intent

Invite yjlou as collaborator to solarized-prism-theme

## RM

Thoughts: The Invite modal is still open with "yjlou" populated and the role set to Developer, and the Invite action appears not to have completed (the Invite button is disabled/greyed and there's no confirmation or new member entry in the members list). The modal remaining open with no visible success indication means the invitation was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: I'll plan to use this later — once I'm in the repository I should check the Members/Settings > Members page to see existing collaborators and avoid including the requester when listing members. So: use Memory 1 later.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check the repository Members page...) is relevant: I should navigate to the project's Members page to add/invite a collaborator and to confirm current members (excluding the requester). I'll use this memory.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it tells me to check the repository Members page (where I can invite a collaborator) and to exclude the requester when listing collaborators — that's directly relevant to inviting yjlou. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because those are about composing engagement posts and constraints, which aren't relevant to inviting a collaborator on the GitLab project.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check the repository Members page and exclude the requester when listing collaborators" — I will not use this memory now because you already specified the exact user (yjlou) to invite; we don't need to list or exclude other members at this moment.
===============INFO - I'll examine the memory items first to decide whether to use them.
===============INFO - I will consider the three memory items first and decide whether to use them now:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check Members page): I will NOT actively navigate away to re-check the Members list because the Members page is already visible behind the open "Invite members" modal and shows current members — yjlou does not appear in the list. So I don't need to use Memory 1 right now.
