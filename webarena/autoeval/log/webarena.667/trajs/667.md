## Intent

Submit a merge request for dialog-component branch to be merged into bump-doctocat branch, assign primer as the reviewer

## RM

Thoughts: The agent located an existing merge request titled "Autocomplete interface guideline updates (#267)" that merges dialog-component into bump-doctocat, and it requested/assigned "Primer" as the reviewer (sidebar shows Reviewer: Primer). It also informed the user and noted merge is blocked by conflicts. Because the MR already exists and the reviewer was assigned as requested, the agent completed the user's intent.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'I checked the merge request page: a merge request titled "Autocomplete interface guideline updates (#267

## Captions

===============INFO - We need to create a new merge request from branch dialog-component into bump-doctocat and assign primer as reviewer. I'll use the project Merge requests page to start (Memory 3 is directly relevant). Memory 1 (prefer review-assignment filters) is about finding existing MRs requiring review — not relevant for creating a new MR, so I won't use it. Memory 2 (prefer creating MRs for sensitive changes) is a general guideline to prefer MRs over direct pushes — it's relevant as a reminder to create the MR, but it doesn't change the immediate action.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer review-assignment filters): Not relevant for creating a new merge request; I will not use it now.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prefer review-assignment filters..." — Not relevant for this step because I'm creating a new merge request, not searching MR lists. I will not use this memory now.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prefer review-assignment filters over authorship/commit filters" — Not needed. That memory is for finding MRs that require review; here I'm creating a new MR and directly assigning a reviewer, so it doesn't apply.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer review-assignment filters over authorship/commit filters): I will not use this memory right now — I'm already on the specific merge request page and don't need to search MR lists or apply filters.
