## Intent

Given the following locations, ['Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'Harvard University', 'Boston Logan International Airport'], what would be the optimal route to travel through them all in order to minimize total travel time? Please note the journey begins at the first place listed.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the optimal route starting at MIT and visiting Harvard and Logan to minimize total travel time. The action history and final page snapshot show a route between Logan Airport (green) and Harvard (red) with Directions "Distance: 13km. Time: 0:14" and steps starting at "Airport Road - Arrivals Level." There is no route shown that begins at Massachusetts Institute of Technology nor any comparison of the two possible orders (MIT→Harvard→Logan vs MIT→Logan→Harvard) or their total times. Because the agent ended up displaying only an airport→Harvard route and did not compute the required route starting from MIT or compare alternatives, it did not complete the requested task. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It tells me to fix the origin (MIT) and enumerate permutations of the remaining stops to find the optimal route.
===============INFO - I will use the memories because they describe the correct method for finding the optimal route:
===============INFO - I'll use the saved memories to guide the approach:
===============INFO - I will use the memories:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It says to fix the first location (MIT) as the origin and evaluate permutations of the remaining stops — I'll keep MIT as the origin for now.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to fix the origin (MIT) and evaluate permutations of the remaining stops. I will fix MIT as the start.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories that say: fix the origin and enumerate the permutations of the remaining stops (Memory 1), sum leg times for each candidate full route (Memory 2), and only enumerate the necessary permutations with the start fixed (Memory 3). All three are relevant and I'll use them.
