The agent never produced an answer describing the optimal visiting order (e.g., MIT \u2192 Harvard \u2192 Logan or MIT \u2192 Logan \u2192 Harvard) nor confirmed travel times, and it failed to keep the required start point (MIT).

The action history and final page snapshot show a route between Logan Airport (green) and Harvard (red) with Directions \"Distance: 13km.
