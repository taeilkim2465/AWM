## Intent

What is the top-1 best-selling product type in Jan 2023

## RM

Thoughts: The agent ran the Bestsellers report for Period=Month and From/To = 1/1/23–1/31/23, inspected the report table, and reported the top Order Quantity = 2 with a three-way tie (Overnight Duffle; Hawkeye Yoga Short-32-Blue; Impulse Duffle). It also flagged the ambiguity of "product type" (individual product vs. aggregated product-type) and offered to export or adjust grouping if the user meant an aggregated type. The response therefore either answers the user's question (as individual top products) or explicitly states the limitation for aggregated product-type data — meeting the information-seeking success criteria.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Result and reasoning:\n- I used Memory 1 and Memory 3 (not Memory 2

===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they directly describe how to get a correct "top-1 best-selling" result for a specific month:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items to guide how I retrieve the best-seller for Jan 2023:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it reminds me to ensure the report is grouped by the product-level dimension that defines "best-selling". I will try to set the report period and run the report; if there is no explicit "product type" grouping control on this page, I'll rely on the Product/Order Quantity output and identify the top item from the results.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use? Yes (partially). It advises grouping by product-level dimension and sorting by the correct metric. The current report already shows product-level rows and is sorted by Order Quantity, so I'll rely on that guidance to interpret the table.

I can try to export the CSV or adjust report grouping if that option exists—would you like me to do that?")
