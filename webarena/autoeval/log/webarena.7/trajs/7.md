## Intent

Tell me the full address of all international airports that are within a driving distance of 50 km to Carnegie Mellon University

## RM

Thoughts: The user requested full addresses of all international airports within a 50 km driving distance of Carnegie Mellon University (an information-seeking task). The action history shows repeated searches but the final page snapshot only displays search results for Carnegie Mellon University (no airport search results or addresses, and no distance/route filtering). The agent did not present any airport addresses nor explicitly state that such information is unavailable. Therefore the required information was not obtained or reported.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. The task requires "within 50 km driving distance", so I must compute route-based driving distances (not straight-line). I'll use the map's directions/routing feature to measure driving distance from Carnegie Mellon University to candidate airports.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Measure driving distance/time using a routing service): I will use this. The task requires driving-distance-based inclusion, and the OpenStreetMap directions widget (OSRM) can compute driving routes.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows before taking the next step:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use route-based driving distances (yes). This task requires checking "within 50 km driving distance", so I should compute driving distances with a routing service rather than straight-line distances.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — I should compute driving distances using routing (not straight-line). I'll plan to confirm candidate airports with the map first, then compute driving distances using a routing/directions feature. Memory 2 (use): Yes — when I identify airports I will gather their full postal addresses and estimate driving distances; this will guide next steps. Memory 3 (use): Yes — I'll retrieve official postal addresses from authoritative sources (airport websites) once I identify the candidate airports.
===============INFO - We need to compute driving distances (not straight-line) from Carnegie Mellon University to candidate international airports and then report full postal addresses for those within 50 km driving distance.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — the task requires "within 50 km driving distance", so I will use route-based driving distance rather than straight-line. Memory 1 advises computing driving distances via a routing service; the OpenStreetMap directions UI on the page uses OSRM (a routing engine), so I'll use that to get a driving distance to candidate airports.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide the approach:
