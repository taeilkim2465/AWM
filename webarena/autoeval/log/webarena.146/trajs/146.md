## Intent

What is the size configuration of the picture frame I bought Sep 2022

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows Order #000000175 dated September 1, 2022, but the visible item is a Disney Mickey Mouse T‑Shirt (with its Size field not visible in the screenshot). There is no picture frame or its size configuration shown in the snapshot, and no explicit answer was provided to the user’s question. Therefore the agent did not retrieve the requested picture frame size information.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will check the memory items to decide which to use:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 to try to increase the results-per-page on the orders list (if that control exists) so I can find the Sep 2022 order quickly. I will not actively use Memory 2 right now, but I will follow it if the order list is inaccessible or hidden (I'll report what I checked and offer next steps). I will keep Memory 3 in mind to present a small set of clear next-step choices after I find the orders.
===============INFO - I need to find the order from Sep 2022 to check the picture frame size. The orders list currently shows 10 items per page and only 2023 orders, so older (Sep 2022) orders are likely on a later page.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Increase results‑per‑page): I will use this memory — the page is already set to 50 per page (max), so we don't need to change pagination before scanning orders.
===============INFO - Memory review and plan:
===============INFO - I will try to show more orders on one page so I can find the Sep 2022 order without jumping through multiple pages.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (increase results-per-page): I will use this memory as a check — the page already shows "Show 50 per page", so the listing is already at the largest page size and I don't need to change it.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (increase results-per-page) because it helps when scanning the orders list so I can find the Sep 2022 order faster. I will also use Memory 3 (offer concise next-step choices) after I report findings so you can pick what to do next. I will not use Memory 2 right now because I don't yet know if any view or permission will block access; if that happens I'll describe what I checked and present alternatives.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (increase results-per-page) because showing more orders on one page will make it much quicker to find an order from Sep 2022 and avoid pagination. I will not use Memory 2 right now (explain next steps if blocked) — I'll only invoke that if the order data becomes inaccessible. I will use Memory 3 (offer clear next-step choices) after I locate the relevant order so you can pick what you want me to do next.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (increase results-per-page): I will not use this — the page is already set to 50 per page (value='50'), so no change needed.
