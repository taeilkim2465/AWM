===============INFO - Memory 1 (avoid locking top-N) is useful for this single-item task — I'll operate directly on the newest post after sorting by "new", so I will use Memory 1.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It advises operating directly on the top item when the task is to act on the single newest post — that's appropriate here.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because the task targets the single newest post and I should sort by "new" and then act on the top item directly. I will NOT use Memory 2 (not needed for choosing and upvoting the newest post) and NOT use Memory 3 (it's about locking a top‑10 set which is unnecessary for a single newest post).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Avoid locking or capturing a top‑N set): I will use this. The task targets the single newest post, so after sorting by "New" I'll act directly on the top item instead of collecting many posts.
===============INFO - Memory check:
