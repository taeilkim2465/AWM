## Intent

DisLike all submissions created by jacyanthis in subreddit earthporn

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked the agent to dislike all submissions by "jacyanthis" in subreddit "earthporn". The agent performed multiple searches and ultimately ran the query "author:jacyanthis subreddit:earthporn". The final page clearly shows "No results for author:jacyanthis subreddit:earthporn" and "There are no entries to display," so there are no submissions on this site to dislike. The agent reported this to the user and offered next steps (broaden search, try Reddit, or try username variations). Given there were no matching items to modify and the agent correctly searched and informed the user, the task was handled appropriately. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'I searched for author:jacyanthis in subreddit:earthporn on this site and there are no matching submissions to dislike. Would you like me to broaden the search, try Reddit directly, or attempt username variations?'

===============INFO - I will use the saved memories to guide the approach:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created matching item): I will use this — it suggests searching by keyword then picking the newest results, which is useful once we find posts by the user.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created matching item): I will use this — when we find submissions by jacyanthis, we should act on the newest ones first.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (locate newest matching item) — I will use this: we need to find submissions by "jacyanthis", so searching by that username and sorting/inspecting results by date is relevant.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they tell me to find matching items and prioritize the newest posts first — that is useful for locating all submissions by jacyanthis in r/earthporn and acting on the most recent ones first. I will not use Memory 2 because posting restrictions and permission checks are about submitting content, not about downvoting existing submissions.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created matching item): USE. It suggests searching/filtering by keywords and acting on the newest matches first — helpful if results appear.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created matching item): I will use this memory as a guideline if we find multiple matching posts — we should act on the newest first. Right now there are no matching results, so it can't be applied yet but I keep it in mind.
