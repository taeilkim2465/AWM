## Intent

Show me the product names for order number 148.

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot of Order #000000148 shows only one item ("Bornbridge Artificial Spiral Topiary Tree - Indoor / Outdoor Topiary Trees - Artificial Outdoor Plants (2 Pack, 4' Cypress)") in the Items Ordered section. The agent's message listed a second product (Russound 5B45W 4" Indoor Outdoor Speakers White) that does not appear in the visible order details, so the agent returned incorrect information and did not accurately reflect the page content. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Product names for order #148:\n\n1. Bornbridge Artificial Spiral Topiary Tree - Indoor / Outdoor Topiary Trees - Artificial Outdoor Plants (2 Pack, 4' Cypress

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (price computation and sorting) because the user only asked for product names for order 148; computing or sorting prices isn't needed for this request.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It reminds me to open the order detail page and extract product-level info directly (not from summary rows). Even though you only asked for product names, I'll open the order details so I can read each product entry reliably.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it instructs to open the order detail and extract product-level info (names/prices). I will open the order detail page for order 000000148 to get accurate product names (and prices if needed).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It concerns computing and sorting discounted prices from order details; the user only asked for product names, and the names are visible on the current order page.
