## Intent

Show me products under $25 in "women shoes" category

## RM

Thoughts: The user requested products under $25 in "women shoes". The agent searched and applied price options but the final page snapshot shows product prices of $45.25, $39.99, $83.95, $27.90, $52.92, $29.99, $27.21, etc. There are no products under $25 visible, and the agent did not present any matching items or state that none exist. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"
