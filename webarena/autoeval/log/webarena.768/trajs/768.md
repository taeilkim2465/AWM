## Intent

5 blue Cronus yoga pants with size 33 arrived, update the stock

## RM

Thoughts: The quantity field in the final page shows 5 (so the numeric stock was updated), but the Stock Status dropdown still displays "Out of Stock" (the open list even shows Out of Stock selected). The user asked to mark the 5 items as arrived—i.e. set stock to In Stock. Because the Stock Status was not changed/persisted to In Stock, the update is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: I'll use this. Inventory is stored at the variant (child) level, so I need to open the specific variant/SKU for Blue size 33 and update its stock rather than editing the parent product's overall stock.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It warns inventory is stored at the variant (child) level and tells me to open the specific variant/SKU to read the size and variant-specific stock field — this is directly relevant for updating size 33 blue pants.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because inventory for sizes is stored at the variant (child/simple product) level — I should open the specific variant record for Cronus Yoga Pant size 33 Blue. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 right now (no need to create variants or scan for low-stock ranges at this moment).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it says inventory is at the variant level and to edit the variant record. I'm already on the variant "Cronus Yoga Pant -33-Blue" page so I should update the variant Quantity field directly.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check variant-level records for accurate size and stock): I will use this — the page I'm on is the variant (Cronus Yoga Pant -33-Blue) so updating the Quantity and Stock Status here updates the size/color-specific (child) record as Memory 1 recommends.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — this is a variant-level page (Cronus Yoga Pant -33-Blue). Memory 1 is relevant because per-size inventory is stored on the variant page, and we're already on the variant so we should update the variant's stock fields here.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - We need to update the variant-level stock record for "Cronus Yoga Pant -33-Blue" so the 5 newly arrived items (size 33, blue) are reflected. I'll explicitly consider the provided memories:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (variant-level records): I will use this — we're editing the specific variant "Cronus Yoga Pant -33-Blue", so we must update the variant's Quantity and Stock Status fields (not the parent product).
