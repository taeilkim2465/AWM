## Intent

Show me the order date for order number 148.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent located order 000000148 on the My Orders page and reported the date as 1/29/23. The final webpage screenshot shows order 000000148 with date 1/29/23, so the agent provided the correct information and an appropriate follow-up question.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Order 000000148 was placed on 1/29/23. Would you like me to open the order details?'

===============INFO - I'll check the memory items first:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (filter by canceled orders) because the user asked for the date of a specific order (order 148); filtering by status is unnecessary and could hide the order if its status isn't "Canceled".
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Filter by order status and sort by date): Not needed — the orders list is already visible and I can see order 000000148 directly, so I won't apply filters or sorting.
