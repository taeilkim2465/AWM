## Intent

How much I spent on cooking and food shopping during March 2022

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only opened a single order page (Order #000000169 dated March 2, 2022) and the screenshot shows line-item prices for that order. The user asked for total spending on cooking and food shopping during March 2022, which requires gathering all March 2022 orders (and/or filtering by relevant categories) and summing amounts. The action history and final page do not show any date-range filtering, category filtering, or a computed total across the month, so the user's request was not fulfilled.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Always verify the date format on the current page): I will use this — I should confirm how the site displays dates (MM/DD vs DD/MM) when I get to the orders page to avoid misreading March dates.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they are directly relevant: I should verify the site's date format on the orders page before interpreting dates, and I should look for date-range filters or summary totals so I can get March 2022 totals without opening every order. I will not use Memory 3 (nearby supermarkets) because it's irrelevant to this task.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2, and not Memory 3.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (verify date format): I will use this. The page shows dates like 6/30/22 and 3/2/22 — that indicates month/day/year (US-style), so "3/2/22" is March 2, 2022.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (verify date format): I will use this — before interpreting any ambiguous dates I should confirm the site’s date format on the orders list page.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (verify date format): I will use this — I should confirm whether the site uses MM/DD/YY or DD/MM/YY before interpreting "3/10/23" as March 10 vs October 3. I can confirm from the visible dates (e.g., 5/17/23, 3/11/23) and by checking nearby entries after loading more orders.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (verify date format): I will use this — the order page shows the full date "March 2, 2022", so the site clearly uses Month name, confirming the date is in March 2022.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (verify date format): I will use this. I see dates like "5/17/23" and "3/11/23" on the page, which indicates the site displays dates in month/day/year format (MM/DD/YY). That means "3/..." refers to March.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (verify date format): I will use this. The orders list shows dates like 6/30/22 and 5/22/22, which indicates the site uses month/day/year, so "3/2/22" and "3/10/22" are March dates.
