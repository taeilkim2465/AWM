## Intent

create a new group "coding_friends" with members qhduan, Agnes-U

## RM

Thoughts: The group "coding_friends" appears to have been created (visible in the sidebar), and the invite modal shows two selected users (Agnes-U and a user whose display name appears different but likely corresponds to qhduan). However the modal is still open and the "Invite" button appears disabled/unfinished (greyed with a spinner-like indicator), so the invitations were not confirmed/sent and the members are not actually added. Therefore the agent did not complete the full task of creating the group with those members added.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as guidance:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory review (decide whether to use each now):
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — the page shows a success banner "Group coding_friends was successfully created.", so I'll confirm creation before continuing.
===============INFO - We need to add members to the group. The left sidebar already shows the group "coding_friends", so the group appears to exist. I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to guide the next steps:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The UI shows "You're viewing members of coding_friends" and the members table, so the group exists — I'll still follow the memory and ensure the invite flow completes by waiting for the invite dialog to appear before adding members.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm entity creation completed before performing follow-up actions" — I will use this. The group page and the "Invite members" modal are already open, so it appears the group exists and the UI is ready. I'll proceed but remain aware to look for a success message after inviting.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm entity creation completed before performing follow-up actions" — I will use this. The page shows we're on the coding_friends group members page and the "Invite members" modal is open, so the group creation is already confirmed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm entity creation completed before performing follow-up actions" — I will use this memory. We're already on the group's Members page (the group exists), so this confirms we are operating on the right group before inviting members.
