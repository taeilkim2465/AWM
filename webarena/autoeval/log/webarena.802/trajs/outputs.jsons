However the modal is still open and the \"Invite\" button appears disabled/unfinished (greyed with a spinner-like indicator), so the invitations were not confirmed/sent and the members are not actually added. Therefore the agent did not complete the full task of creating the group with those members added.", "status": "failure"}}
