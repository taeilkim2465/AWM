## Intent

How much did I spend on shopping at One Stop Market on November 2022? They gave me a 20% discount on the total amount for orders exceeding $200 in cash

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task (compute November 2022 spending net of a 20% cash discount). The agent only asked clarifying questions and did not compute or report the November 2022 total nor state the information is unavailable. The visible page shows an orders list but does not display November 2022 orders or payment method details needed to apply the cash discount. Because the agent did not provide the requested total (or an explicit inability to do so), the task is not completed.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compute product spend by summing line-item totals and document adjustments): I will use this. It's important to sum product line-item amounts and explicitly handle order-level discounts, taxes, shipping, and refunds when computing the November 2022 spend.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because I need to sum product and order totals and properly account for discounts and adjustments when computing the November 2022 spend. I will use Memory 2 to prompt the user a clarifying question about whether to include shipping/taxes or only item totals (and to offer to search for other orders on the same date) — I should ask that before finalizing the total. I will use Memory 3 when I open individual order details to extract product-level pricing and confirm applied discounts if needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It tells me to sum product line-item amounts and handle discounts, taxes, shipping, and refunds — that is necessary to compute net spend accurately.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It tells me to sum product line-item totals and account for order-level discounts, taxes, shipping, and refunds — I'll need this when I compute the November 2022 spend (especially because there is a 20% order-level discount condition).
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (sum product line-items and handle discounts/refunds) because it tells me how to compute totals and document adjustments — important for an accurate November spend. I will use Memory 2 (ask which amount to record and whether to include shipping) because it explicitly says to clarify whether to include shipping/taxes and whether to include other orders on that date; the user hasn't specified this exactly. I will use Memory 3 (verify product-level metadata on order detail pages) if I need to open each order to confirm line-item amounts and discounts, but I won't open order details until the user confirms which totals they want.
