Add a white desk to my wish list.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Refine ambiguous searches): I will use this — it advises to include specific product attributes and refine until a single product is identifiable. I'll start with a clear query "white desk".
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Refine ambiguous searches): I will use this—results are broad but there is a clear product entry for a white desk (Techni Mobili...) so I'll pick a distinct product from the results rather than refining the search further.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Refine ambiguous searches): Not needed — we already have a specific product page open for a white desk, so no further search refinement is required.
