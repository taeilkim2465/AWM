## Intent

Lookup orders that are on hold

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to look up orders with status "On Hold". The action history shows the agent set the Status filter to "On Hold" and refreshed the list. The final page clearly shows "Active filters: Status: On Hold" and the message "We couldn't find any records," so the agent correctly applied the filter and reported that no on-hold orders exist. This satisfies the information-seeking task by explicitly stating the information is not available.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (prefer live lookups for time-sensitive items) because the order statuses are dynamic and I should query the live Magento UI rather than rely on cached memory. I will not use Memory 1 (verify product pages) because this task is about orders, not product slot/layouts. I will not use Memory 3 (ZIP code sources) because it's unrelated.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify capacity and internal layout on product pages): Not relevant for this task (it's about products), so I will not use it.
