Thoughts: The page's directions panel clearly shows Distance: 1.4 km and Time: 0:18. The agent selected the Foot (OSRM) profile, generated the route, and told the user "about an 18‑minute walk (distance ~1.4 km)", which matches the page. The response directly answers the user's question and offers follow-up options, so the information-seeking task is completed successfully.
