## Intent

Make all Aeno capri as out of stock

## RM

Thoughts: The agent attempted to set stock to 0 and change stock status to "Out of Stock" (actions 11–14 and repeated 17–20), but the final page snapshot for "Aeon Capri-28-Orange" still shows Quantity = 100 (and product enabled), so the out-of-stock change was not applied. The user wanted all Aeno capri items out of stock; the final state does not reflect that, so the task failed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Operate at the correct inventory granularity (product vs variant)" — I will use this. Inventory updates often must be made at the variant/SKU level, so I'll make sure to check variant rows and edit SKU-level stock if products have variants.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Operate at the correct inventory granularity): I will use this memory later when updating stock (we must change inventory at variant/SKU level if needed). Not used for this immediate action, but I'll keep it in mind.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as follows before proceeding:
===============INFO - Memory review — I'll state whether I will use each memory item for this step:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Operate at the correct inventory granularity): I will use this — inventory is tracked per variant/SKU, so I must update each variant rather than only the configurable product-level setting.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Operate at the correct inventory granularity): I will use this. It’s important to remember inventory can be tracked at variant/SKU level — I should update each variant (or each simple product) individually rather than assuming a product-level change will affect all SKUs. For this step I’ll update the currently-open product (Aeon Capri-28-Black) and later iterate other variants.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Operate at the correct inventory granularity): I will use this — inventory can be per-variant/SKU, so I should make sure to adjust each variant rather than assuming a product-level change covers all variants.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Operate at the correct inventory granularity): I will use this — Aeon Capri is a configurable product with simple product variants, so I must update inventory at the variant (simple product) level.
