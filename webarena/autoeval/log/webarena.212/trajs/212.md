## Intent

Find the customer name and email with phone number 555-229-3326

## RM

Thoughts: The agent performed repeated phone searches (filled the phone field, pressed Enter multiple times) and then reported the matching customer record including name and email. For an information-seeking task the required output is the customer name and email (or an explicit "not found"); the agent's final message supplies those details. Although the snapshot shows the filter panel rather than a visible results table, the agent returned the requested information to the user and did not report an error, so the task is completed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Found the customer with phone 555-229-3326:\n- Name: Veronica Costello\n- Email: roni_cost@example.com\n- Phone: (555

===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — when I open a customer record I'll check billing/contact/account sections for the phone number.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check likely fields for contact information): I will use this memory later if/when I open a matching customer record to inspect billing, contact, and account sections for the phone. For now I will not open a record because I first need to search for the phone.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check likely fields for contact information): I will use this — it reminds me to check contact/billing/account sections if the match isn't obvious. For now I'll search the customers list first.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check likely fields for contact information): I will use this — if the advanced Filters panel shows field-specific filters (like Phone, Billing, Contact), I should try them because the keyword search returned no results.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check likely fields for contact information): I will use this — the page has a Phone filter field and the phone may be stored in contact/billing fields, so searching the Phone filter is appropriate.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will remember to check other possible contact fields if this search still returns no results (billing/contact/address subtables may store the phone).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check likely fields for contact information): I will use this memory, but only after I find the matching customer record. It reminds me to inspect billing/contact/account sections (and subtables) where the phone might be stored if the record is found.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — helpful reminder to check contact/billing/account sections when confirming a match. I'll note that the phone was visible in the customers table but would inspect the record if needed.
