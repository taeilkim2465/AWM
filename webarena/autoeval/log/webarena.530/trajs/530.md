## Intent

Draft a refund message via their "contact us" form for the kitchen organizer I bought around Feb 2023. It broke after three days of use. The shop requires the order id, the reason and the amount to refund in the message. Don't submit yet

## RM

Thoughts: The agent provided a complete refund message draft that includes the required order ID placeholder, the reason (product broke after three days of normal use), and the refund amount placeholder. The user explicitly asked not to submit; the agent returned the draft to the user rather than submitting the form. These satisfy the user's request.
Status: "success"
