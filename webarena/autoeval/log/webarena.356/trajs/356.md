## Intent

Show the route from SCS CMU in Pittsburgh to the location where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed

## RM

Thoughts: The origin and destination fields are correctly filled (SCS CMU, Pittsburgh → Independence Hall, Philadelphia) and the directions widget is visible with the "Go" button, but the map does not show a generated route polyline between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia—only the region and a destination marker are visible. The repeated clicks/Enter on the page did not produce a displayed route, so the agent did not complete the user's request to show the route.
Status: "failure"
