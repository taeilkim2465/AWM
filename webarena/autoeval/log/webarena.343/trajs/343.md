## Intent

List all opened issues that don't have any labels

## RM

Thoughts: The agent attempted to apply the label:none filter several times, but the final page snapshot shows the open issues view with no visible filter token or results listing the unlabeled issues (just placeholders). The agent did not return the requested list of open issues without labels nor explicitly state the data is unavailable. Therefore the information-seeking task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use? Yes — it reminds me to default to the Issues list and treat label scope sensibly. The user explicitly asked for "opened issues" so the default aligns with their request.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to assume "open" issues by default, which matches the user's request, so I will list open issues without labels.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — the user asked for opened issues without labels; default to open issues is appropriate so I won't change the view from "Open".
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 and Memory 3 because they say to use the repository's Issues list and its built-in filters — we're already on that page and the search is set to label:none. I will not use Memory 1 right now because the query already explicitly requests issues with no labels (label:none) and the view is already filtered to open issues.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — apply the default assumption that the user means open issues with no labels (so filter for open issues and label:none). Memory 2: Use — the Issues list is the right view (we're already on it). Memory 3: Use — use the Issues view search/filter bar to apply the label filter.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it says to default to listing open issues when label/ state is ambiguous. The user asked for "opened issues", so this matches and I will assume we only need open issues.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it tells me to default to open issues and interpret label requests; relevant because the user asked for "opened issues that don't have any labels" and the Issues view is already on "Open".
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Default assumptions): I will use this — the user asked for "opened issues that don't have any labels", so defaulting to open issues is appropriate. The current Issues view is already set to Open, so this matches the default.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it tells me to default to open issues and treat label requests as "label:none" which matches the user's request for opened issues without labels.
