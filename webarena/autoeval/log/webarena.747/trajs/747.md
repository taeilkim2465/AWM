## Intent

Start a private project awesome_web_agents with blank template and add Abishek, Vinta as members

## RM

Thoughts: The Activity page confirms the project awesome_web_agents was created (activity shows "Created project Byte Blaze / awesome_web_agents"), but there is no visible indication the project visibility was set to private nor any evidence that a blank template was selected. Crucially, there is no sign that members Abishek or Vinta were added (no member-creation activity or members listed). Because the required steps to set privacy and add the two members are not verifiably completed, the task is not successful.
Status: "failure"
