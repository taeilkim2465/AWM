## Intent

I have jaw bruxism problem, show me something that could alleviate the problem.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for something to alleviate jaw bruxism (e.g., a night guard). The agent searched for "night guard for bruxism" but the final page shows unrelated product showcases (gingerbread kit, drinks, tea, sprinkles, coconut whip) rather than night guards or relevant information. Because the results do not contain the requested product or an explicit statement that it is unavailable, the agent did not fulfill the user's request.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Disambiguate venue requests): Not relevant to this task (it's about stadiums/teams), so I will not use it.
