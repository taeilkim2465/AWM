{"id": 629, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This was a content-modification task (create a post). The agent prepared the exact post title/body and explicitly followed its memory to confirm before posting, then asked the user for confirmation instead of posting. The page snapshot shows no post titled \"Fun thing to do in Pittsburgh\" (the visible submission by MarvelsGrantMan136 is a different post), so the requested post was not created. Because the agent did not complete the post creation, the task is not finished.", "status": "failure"}}
