The agent's actions show only clicks and a clarifying question asking which address to update and confirmation of recipient/phone/apartment. The page snapshot still displays the old address (654 Aspen Road, House #3, Boston, MA 02110) for both billing and shipping and shows \"Change Billing Address\"/\"Change Shipping Address\" links, indicating no update was made. Because the agent did not perform the modification after asking, the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
