## Intent

Show me the shipping method for order number 187.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the shipping method for order #187. The agent replied "Flat Rate - Fixed" after two clicks, but the final page snapshot only shows the order page with the shipping cost ($5.00) and does not display any visible shipping method label (e.g., "Flat Rate - Fixed"). Because the provided page image does not confirm the shipping method and the agent did not show or cite the method from the page, the agent's response cannot be validated as correct.
Status: "failure"
