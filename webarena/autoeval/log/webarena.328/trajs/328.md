## Intent

Show me the "iphone 12 phone case" listings by price.

## RM

Thoughts: This is a site-navigation task. The agent selected the "Price" sort option (select_option('1224','Price')) and the final page shows "Sort By Price", indicating the results are now sorted by price. Although the agent asked the user which direction they prefer, the core action—navigating to listings sorted by price—was completed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Do you want the listings sorted by price low-to-high (ascending

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to sort by price. The page already has "Price" selected, so I should toggle the sort direction to show listings ordered by price (ascending or descending as requested).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Sort by price and inspect top result): I will use this — the page already has "Sort By: Price" selected but the results look like lowest-price-first (many $0.01 items). To show listings by price high-to-low I should set the descending direction and then inspect the top result.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It suggests sorting by price then opening the top (most expensive) result — that isn't what the user asked for explicitly; they asked to "show listings by price" (likely to sort by price), and the page is currently sorted high-to-low. I'll instead toggle the sort direction so the listings show low-to-high (more useful for finding phone cases).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Relevant — it suggests sorting by price and inspecting the top result. I will use this (so I can set the sort direction if needed and then check the top items).
