## Intent

Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked the agent to add the cheapest-per-unit product from the user's open tabs to the cart. The agent correctly computed the current page's per-unit price ($15.99 / 2 ≈ $8.00) and informed the user it cannot access other open tabs, then asked whether to (A) check other tabs (if switched or given URLs) or (B) add the current product now. The agent did not switch to other tabs, compute per-unit prices across tabs, or add any item to the cart. The page snapshot shows the product and an "Add to Cart" button, but that button was not clicked. Because the required action (adding the lowest per‑unit product from the open tabs to the cart) was not completed, this is a failure.

Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I will use all three memories (unit normalization and comparability

## Captions

===============INFO - I will consider each memory item now and decide whether to use it.

User Intent: Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart

Action History:
1: send_msg_to_user("I will use all three memories (unit normalization and comparability) to choose the cheapest product per unit. On this page the product is $15.99 for a 2‑pack → $15.99 / 2 = $7.995 (~$8.00 each). I can’t see your other open tabs from here, so I can’t automatically find the lowest per‑unit price across them. Do you want me to: (A) check the other product tabs (please either switch me to each product tab or paste their product URLs here) so I can compute per‑unit prices and add the cheapest one; or (B) just add this current product to the cart now?")
