{"id": 120, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This is an information-seeking task. The agent produced a clear list of likely reasons customers like \"Ana Running Short\" and cited observable evidence from the product admin list (variants, visibility, consistent price, stock counts, configurable product type, enabled status, last updated).
