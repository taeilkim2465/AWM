## Intent

Open my latest created issue that has theme editor in its title to check if it is closed

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened an issue titled "Tm Theme Editor" (action history shows navigation and the assistant's message). The provided page snapshot clearly displays a green "Open" status and a "Close issue" button next to the issue title, matching the agent's statement that the issue is currently OPEN. This satisfies the user's request to open the latest issue with "theme editor" in the title and check whether it is closed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I found the issue titled \"Tm Theme Editor\" (contains \"theme editor\"
