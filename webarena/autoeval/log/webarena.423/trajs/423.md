## Intent

Mark all Hollister shirts on sale

## RM

Thoughts: This is a content-modification task. The agent correctly filtered the catalog to "Hollister" (16 records) and attempted to open "Update attributes", but repeatedly requested sale details from the user and reported a page overlay blocked the click. No sale price/percent or start/end dates were provided and no attribute was actually updated in the action history or final page snapshot. Therefore the modification (marking shirts on sale) was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I can proceed to put all Hollister products on sale, but I need the sale details to continue. Please tell me:\n1

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compute price ranges from product pages and variant data): I will not use this right now. It will be useful later if I need to determine sale prices or verify price ranges across variants, but first I need to open the product list.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compute price ranges): I will not use this memory right now — it's useful later if we need to determine sale price ranges across variants, but first I need to find the Hollister shirt products in the catalog.

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. This will be useful later to ensure the sale price we set is correct across variants (collect variant prices / sale vs regular price). I'll apply it when we set the price so we don't accidentally set an invalid range.

Please tell me:\n1) Do you want an absolute Special Price (e.g. 39.00) or a percent-off discount (e.g. 25%)?\n2) If percent-off, should it be applied to each product\'s current price? If absolute, confirm the dollar amount.\n3) Do you want a sale start and end date/time (include timezone)? If yes, provide both start and end (e.g. 2026-02-01 09:00 PST to 2026-02-10 23:59 PST).\n4) Should I set the Special Price attribute (recommended) or a different attribute?\n5) Apply to all simple variants only, or also update the configurable parent product(s)?\n\nNote: I filtered the catalog to \"Hollister\" (16 records). I attempted to select all and open \"Update attributes\" but a page overlay blocked the click — once you confirm the above I will retry and apply the update.')
