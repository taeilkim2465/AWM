## Intent

Submit a merge request for the branch that implements the support of template strings to be merged into master branch, assign myself and Roshan as the reviewer

## RM

Thoughts: The final page still shows "Select source branch" and the "Compare branches and continue" button — no source branch was chosen and no merge request was created. There is also no evidence that assignees/reviewers (you and Roshan) were assigned. Because the agent did not select the source branch or complete and submit the MR, the user's intent (create MR into master and assign reviewers) was not fulfilled.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will first check whether a merge request already exists that targets the same source→target branches (source: the branch that implements template strings → target: master/main). This avoids creating duplicates (use Memory 2 and Memory 3). If no existing MR is found, I'll open the MR creation form and assign reviewers using the MR reviewer control (use Memory 1).
===============INFO - I will first check for an existing merge request that matches the branch/feature before creating a new one (use Memory 2/3). If none exists, I'll open the New merge request flow and, when creating the MR, I'll use the reviewer control to add you and Roshan (use Memory 1).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use the memories:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - We need to select the source branch (the branch that implements template strings) before continuing. I previously typed "template" into the source branch input (bid 655), and the form still shows the error because a branch wasn't selected from the dropdown.
===============INFO - I will use the memories:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Assign reviewers from MR form): I will use this later when creating or editing the MR to add you and Roshan as reviewers from the MR form. So I plan to use Memory 1 — yes.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Assign reviewers from MR form): I will use this memory later when the MR creation form appears so I can add you and Roshan as reviewers via the reviewer control. Use: YES.
