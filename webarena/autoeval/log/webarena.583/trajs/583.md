## Intent

Create a new forum named PlantsForCatParents, with a description of Cat parents & plan lovers, and include ['Cat friendly', 'Local vendors', 'Promotion', 'Toxic plants!'] in the sidebar?

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the new forum at /f/plantsforcatparents with the visible name "PlantsForCatParents" and the sidebar containing the four items ['Cat friendly', 'Local vendors', 'Promotion', 'Toxic plants!'] as requested. The agent also filled the description as "Cat parents & plant lovers" (the user's intent included "plan lovers" which appears to be a typo), so the created description is correct/reasonable. All required fields were created and the forum appears on the site snapshot, so the task succeeded.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Done — I created the forum '/f/plantsforcatparents' with the visible name 'PlantsForCatParents', description 'Cat parents & plant lovers', and the sidebar items: ['Cat friendly', 'Local vendors', 'Promotion', 'Toxic plants!']. If you want to change anything, use 'Edit forum' or 'Delete forum' in the Toolbox on the right. Would you like me to make any edits now?"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Fill both identifier fields when creating a forum): I will use this memory. When the create-forum form appears I should populate both the visible name and the internal slug/identifier (often separate fields) to avoid mismatches.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Fill both identifier fields when creating a forum) is relevant and I will use it: I'll populate both the Name (internal/slug) and the Title fields to keep naming consistent.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Fill both identifier fields when creating a forum): I will use this — it matches what I did when creating the forum (I filled both the visible name and the internal slug) and helped ensure the forum address is predictable.
