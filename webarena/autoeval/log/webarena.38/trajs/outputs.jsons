{"id": 38, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user wanted to know if Duquesne University can be reached within one hour by car from Pittsburgh International Airport. The agent used the site routing tool (OSRM), filled origin/destination, and the final page snapshot clearly shows \"Distance: 28km. Time: 0:28.\" The agent's reply correctly reports this result and offers sensible follow-ups (traffic-aware estimates, alternate routes). Therefore the agent provided the requested information and the task is completed successfully.", "status": "success"}}
