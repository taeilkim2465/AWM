## Intent

Make all Gobi HeatTec Tee as out of stock

## RM

Thoughts: The intent was to mark all "Gobi HeatTec Tee" products out of stock. The action log shows attempts to set status/quantity (select_option 'Out of Stock', clear/fill quantity to '0') and a keyword filter for "Gobi HeatTec". However the final page snapshot still shows 16 records with positive Quantity and Salable Quantity (e.g., Default Stock: 97, 100, etc.), and no "Out of Stock" status on the listed items. Also product checkboxes appear unchecked, suggesting a mass-action was not applied. Because the visible product stock values were not changed to zero/out of stock, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the provided memories:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Ensure complete visibility of all items for the date" — Not using this memory right now because I'm working on a single product edit page (a specific variant). Pagination/load-more checks aren't relevant for this view.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ensure complete visibility...) is relevant — I will use it to remember to check the full product list after returning to the catalog (look for filters/pagination or "Load more") so we don't miss any Gobi HeatTec Tee SKUs.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ensure complete visibility of all items for the date): I will use this — I need to make sure all Gobi HeatTec items are visible (search/filter) before changing stock so I don't miss variants or paginated rows.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — important to ensure I'm affecting all relevant items. The page shows "16 records found" and per-page is set to 200, so all variants are visible (no pagination or "load more"). Good.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide this final UI step:
