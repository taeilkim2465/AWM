{"id": 502, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The intent was to mark all \"Gobi HeatTec Tee\" products out of stock. The action log shows attempts to set status/quantity (select_option 'Out of Stock', clear/fill quantity to '0') and a keyword filter for \"Gobi HeatTec\". However the final page snapshot still shows 16 records with positive Quantity and Salable Quantity (e.g., Default Stock: 97, 100, etc.), and no \"Out of Stock\" status on the listed items. Also product checkboxes appear unchecked, suggesting a mass-action was not applied. Because the visible product stock values were not changed to zero/out of stock, the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
