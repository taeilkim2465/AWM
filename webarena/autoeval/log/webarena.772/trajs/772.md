## Intent

Delete all pending negative reviews for Circe fleece

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to delete all pending negative reviews for "Circe fleece". The agent only performed a single click (ID '226') and the final screenshot shows the Marketing menu overlay with the "Pending Reviews" option visible but not opened; there is no evidence the agent navigated into Pending Reviews, filtered for the Circe fleece product, identified negative/pending reviews, or deleted any reviews. Therefore the task was not completed.

Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (traverse paginated reviews): I will use this — I need to make sure I check every page of reviews so none are missed.
