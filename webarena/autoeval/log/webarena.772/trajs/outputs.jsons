The agent only performed a single click (ID '226') and the final screenshot shows the Marketing menu overlay with the \"Pending Reviews\" option visible but not opened; there is no evidence the agent navigated into Pending Reviews, filtered for the Circe fleece product, identified negative/pending reviews, or deleted any reviews. Therefore the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
