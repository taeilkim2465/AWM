## Intent

Presents the monthly count of successful orders from Feb to Nov 2022 in MM:COUNT format

## RM

Thoughts: The agent set the date range (02/01/2022–11/30/2022) and Show By = Month, and refreshed, but the final page snapshot only displays detailed customer rows for 02/2022 and no visible aggregated monthly totals for Feb–Nov. There is no evidence the agent extracted or presented the monthly counts in the requested MM:COUNT format (and the agent did not export or summarize the months). Because this is an information-seeking task and the requested summarized output was not produced, the execution failed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. I need to confirm status filters (successful orders), date boundaries (Feb–Nov 2022), and monthly aggregation before collecting counts.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows before taking any action:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It reminds me to confirm status filters, date boundaries, and that the metric is a count — important before collecting each month's count.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm filters, metrics, and date granularity): I will use this. The page already has Status = Complete; I need to confirm/adjust the Purchase Date for each month and ensure "records found" reflects a count (not a list). Using this memory reminds me to verify filters before reading counts.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm filters, metrics, and date granularity): I will use this — I must ensure the Status = Complete filter stays set and that each date range is the full month so counts are month-level totals.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm filters, metrics, and date granularity): I will use this — we must ensure status = Complete and date boundaries are set month-by-month when collecting counts.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm filters...): I will use this — we must ensure status filters and date range are correct before collecting counts.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
