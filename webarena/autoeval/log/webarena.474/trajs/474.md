## Intent

Cancel order 305

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent was to cancel order 305. The final page shows "Order # 000000305" and the "Order Status" field reads "Canceled", indicating the order was successfully canceled. The action history leads to this order view and the final state confirms the change.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check for newer cancelled orders relative to latest active order" — I will not use this memory right now because the UI is showing a specific order (#000000305) and a confirmation modal to cancel it; there's no list view to compare timestamps yet. I'll consider it after cancellation if the user asks for status across orders.
