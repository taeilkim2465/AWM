## Intent

Add the following users to my GitHub timeline item management extension as maintainer: ['abisubramanya27', 'lahwaacz']

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only asked clarification questions (which repo, GitHub vs GitLab, and permissions) and did not perform any actions to add the two users. The screenshot shows a GitLab project list and the agent noted it is on GitLab, while the user requested adding GitHub users — no invites or role changes were made. Therefore the modification task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I’m ready to add those users, but I need a couple of clarifications first:\n\n1

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not useful — it's about adding products to wishlists on product pages, irrelevant to adding users to a repo.
