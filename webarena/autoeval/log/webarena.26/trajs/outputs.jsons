{"id": 26, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent claimed two reviewers (Bob in Vegas and RemyR) with exact quotes about customer service, but the final webpage snapshot only shows a review by \"GoldfishGoldfish\" (posted 4/20/23) and does not contain the quoted customer-service complaints. The agent's response therefore appears to report reviewers/quotes not present in the final page state (fabrication or incorrect extraction), so it did not correctly fulfill the information-seeking task.", "status": "failure"}}
