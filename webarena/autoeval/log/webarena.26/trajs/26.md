## Intent

List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about complain of the customer service

## RM

Thoughts: The agent claimed two reviewers (Bob in Vegas and RemyR) with exact quotes about customer service, but the final webpage snapshot only shows a review by "GoldfishGoldfish" (posted 4/20/23) and does not contain the quoted customer-service complaints. The agent's response therefore appears to report reviewers/quotes not present in the final page state (fabrication or incorrect extraction), so it did not correctly fulfill the information-seeking task.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Record provenance and quote accuracy when listing reviewers): I will use this — it instructs me to include exact short quotes and source locations for any reviewer who mentions customer-service complaints.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they instruct me to capture each matching reviewer's name, an exact short quote, and a clear source location for verification — that's exactly what's needed here. I will not use Memory 2 because it's unrelated (it's about national parks).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they instruct me to capture reviewer name, an exact short quote, and a verifiable source location when reporting reviewers who mention an issue — that's directly relevant to listing reviewers who complain about customer service. I will not use Memory 2 because it's about clarifying "National Park" and is irrelevant here.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It instructs to include exact quoted text and source location when listing reviewers—I'll follow that to avoid misinterpretation.
===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories that guide how to report reviewer findings precisely:
