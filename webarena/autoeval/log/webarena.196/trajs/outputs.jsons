{"id": 196, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for a comparison of payment differences between the last 4 canceled orders and the last 4 completed orders. The action history shows the agent repeatedly toggled the Status filter and ended with Status: Canceled displayed (snapshot shows canceled orders and their totals). There is no evidence the agent collected the last 4 canceled orders and the last 4 completed orders nor performed any calculations or returned those results. The agent never produced the required comparison or explicitly stated the data was unavailable. Therefore the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
