## Intent

Compare the payment difference of the last 4 cancelled orders and completed orders

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for a comparison of payment differences between the last 4 canceled orders and the last 4 completed orders. The action history shows the agent repeatedly toggled the Status filter and ended with Status: Canceled displayed (snapshot shows canceled orders and their totals). There is no evidence the agent collected the last 4 canceled orders and the last 4 completed orders nor performed any calculations or returned those results. The agent never produced the required comparison or explicitly stated the data was unavailable. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows before proceeding:
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I will verify timestamps to ensure I pick the most recent 4 cancelled and most recent 4 completed orders (and call out if a cancelled order is newer than the latest non-cancelled order).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Relevant — I'll keep it in mind to check whether any canceled orders are newer than the most recent completed order and call that out if needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check for newer cancelled orders relative to latest active order" — I will use this. When comparing "last" orders I need to verify timestamps so I don't accidentally pick older orders; I'll check timestamps for canceled vs completed orders after I load the completed orders list.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check for newer cancelled orders relative to latest active order): I will use this — when I collect the "last 4" cancelled and completed orders I must compare timestamps to ensure I'm selecting the most recent ones and call out if cancelled orders are newer than the last active order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check for newer cancelled orders relative to latest active order" — I will use this. I need to ensure I'm looking at the most recent orders (not older ones) when selecting the "last 4" canceled and completed orders, so I'll sort by Purchase Date (descending) after filtering.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check for newer cancelled orders relative to latest active order): I will use this — it reminds me to compare timestamps when I pick the "last 4" orders so I report the most recent ones for each status.
===============INFO - I'll use the reasoning memories to guide this step.
