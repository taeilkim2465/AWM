How much I spent on food-related shopping during March 2023

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only navigated to the "My Orders" list and adjusted page size but did not open individual March 2023 orders to verify which were food-related, nor did it compute or report a total for food purchases in March 2023. The visible orders for March (3/11/23 $65.32, 3/10/23 $17.99, etc.) may include non-food items; without viewing order details or summing confirmed food orders, the user's question is unanswered. Therefore the task is not completed.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they remind me to verify the page's date format before interpreting order dates (to avoid mixing up month/day vs day/month) and to confirm date formatting when matching orders to March 2023. I will NOT use Memory 2 because locating nearby supermarkets is unrelated.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (verify date format): USE — I should confirm the site's date format before assuming "3/11/23" means March 11, 2023. The page layout shows dates as M/D/YY (e.g., 5/17/23), so it's consistent with month/day; I'll rely on that but still keep it in mind when totaling March orders.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 to remind myself to verify the date format when matching orders to March 2023 (even though this page shows the date as "March 11, 2023" which is already unambiguous). I will not use Memory 2 because it is about locating local supermarkets and is not relevant to summing food purchases.
===============INFO - Memory review:

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they remind me to confirm the date format before matching orders to March 2023 — the page shows dates like "5/17/23", which appears to be MM/DD/YY, so March should be "3/..." (this will avoid miscounting). I will NOT use Memory 2 because locating supermarkets is unrelated.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Always verify the date format on the current page): I will use this — it's important to confirm how dates are shown before matching orders to March 2023. The order page currently shows "March 11, 2023", which already looks unambiguous, so this memory just reminds me to confirm other pages also use month-name format.
