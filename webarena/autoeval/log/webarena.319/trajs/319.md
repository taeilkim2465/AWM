How much refund I should expect from my order canlled in April 2022, including shipping fee

## RM

Thoughts: The agent located Order #000000168 (Order Date April 27, 2022) on the page, correctly read the line amounts (Item subtotal $19.86, Shipping & Handling $5.00, Grand total $24.86) and presented the correct refund scenarios (refund including shipping = $24.86; refund of item only = $19.86). The agent also flagged that the page shows the order status as "Complete" rather than "Canceled" and offered appropriate next steps to verify whether a refund was actually issued or whether shipping is refundable. This satisfies the information-seeking intent and provides the correct expected refund amounts and follow-up options.
Status: "success"
