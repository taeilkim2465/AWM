{"id": 319, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent located Order #000000168 (Order Date April 27, 2022) on the page, correctly read the line amounts (Item subtotal $19.86, Shipping & Handling $5.00, Grand total $24.86) and presented the correct refund scenarios (refund including shipping = $24.86; refund of item only = $19.86). The agent also flagged that the page shows the order status as \"Complete\" rather than \"Canceled\" and offered appropriate next steps to verify whether a refund was actually issued or whether shipping is refundable. This satisfies the information-seeking intent and provides the correct expected refund amounts and follow-up options.", "status": "success"}}
