## Intent

Pull up the description page of Whole Foods near Carnegie Mellon on Map

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the OpenStreetMap search results panel listing two Whole Foods Market entries, but no individual place description page is opened or selected. The agent only performed searches (first for "Whole Foods near Carnegie Mellon", then "Whole Foods Market Pittsburgh") and clicked the search button; it did not click a specific search result or load the description for the Whole Foods location near Carnegie Mellon. Therefore the requested description page was not pulled up.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to click a place entry or marker (not the general map) to open the detailed description page once search results appear. I will use Memory 2 to map the user's phrase into a concrete search query ("Whole Foods near Carnegie Mellon") rather than guessing an exact store name. I will not use Memory 3 right now because I first need to run the search and view the results before deciding whether to inspect link targets.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It reminds me to open the place entry or marker (not the general map) to reach the description page once we have results. Right now the search returned "No results", but I'll follow this guidance after getting results.
