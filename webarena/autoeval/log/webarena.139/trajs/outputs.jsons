{"id": 139, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for an estimated driving time between Joe Biden's hometown and Bridgeport (an information-seeking request). The agent only asked a clarifying question (Scranton vs Wilmington and traffic preference) and did not provide the requested driving-time estimate or state that it couldn't be determined. The webpage snapshot shows a general map but no route or travel-time result. Because the agent did not return the requested information or a definitive unavailable statement, the task is incomplete.", "status": "failure"}}
