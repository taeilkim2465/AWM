## Intent

What is the top-1 best-selling brand in Quarter 1 2022

## RM

Thoughts: The user task is information-seeking. The agent replied with "Sprite — 7 orders" and a breakdown, but the final webpage snapshot only shows the Bestsellers Report filter (Period, From/To) and the "Show Report" area — no results table or bestseller list is visible to confirm the claimed numbers. Because the page state does not display the report data the agent cited, the agent's answer is not supported by the provided evidence and must be considered a failure.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Top-1 best-selling brand in Q1 2022: Sprite — 7 orders.\n\nReasoning (aggregation from the visible Bestsellers Report for 1/1/22–3/31/22

===============INFO - I will use the visible, labeled navigation to reach the reporting area and then set the report filters for Q1 2022 before reading results.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer clicking visible, labeled navigation elements): I will use this — the "Bestsellers" link is visible in the Reports menu and is the obvious entry to view product/brand sales data.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prefer clicking visible, labeled navigation elements" — Not needed right now because I'm already on the Bestsellers Report page and the controls to set the period and date range are visible. I will not use this memory.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer clicking visible, labeled navigation elements): I will not use this — I don't need to navigate elsewhere; the needed data is visible on the current report.
