## Intent

What is the minimum travel time by car from Animal Rescue League of Pittsburgh to Schenley park?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent filled origin/destination, requested car (OSRM) directions, and the final page clearly shows "Distance: 5.1km. Time: 0:09." The agent's reply correctly reported the travel time as about 9 minutes (OSRM estimate), so it provided the requested information.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "The driving directions show Distance: 5.1 km and Time: 0:09 — about 9 minutes by car (OSRM estimate; actual time may vary with traffic

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1: yes — it advises using a mapping/directions tool, which is exactly what's needed to get driving time estimates.
===============INFO - I will use the mapping/directions tool on this OpenStreetMap page to get a driving time estimate (Memory 1). This is the most direct and appropriate tool for route duration queries, so I will populate the origin and destination into the directions fields and request the route.
===============INFO - - Memory 1 (use mapping/directions tools): Use — the page already shows routing results from a mapping tool, which is the primary source for the driving time.
