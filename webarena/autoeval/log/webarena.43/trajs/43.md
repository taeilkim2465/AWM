## Intent

List the top 3 search terms in my store

## RM

Thoughts: The agent returned the requested top 3 search terms with counts and explicitly noted how they were ranked (by "Uses") and that the dashboard widget doesn't show a date range. That satisfies an information-seeking task (provides the data requested and relevant caveats) and offers sensible next actions. Therefore the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Here are the top 3 search terms from your store (source: Magento Admin Dashboard — Top Search Terms widget

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the dedicated list page for "view my items"): I will not use this right now because the dashboard already displays the "Top Search Terms" table with the data needed. If the user wants the full management page, I can use this memory to navigate there next.
