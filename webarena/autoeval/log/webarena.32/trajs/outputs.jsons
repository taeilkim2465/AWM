{"id": 32, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent located a Hilton hotel (Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport \u2014 South/Robinson Mall) on the map and named a nearby supermarket (Giant Eagle), correctly noting Giant Eagle is a regional supermarket headquartered near Pittsburgh. It provided a reasonable walking-distance estimate (0.6\u20130.9 miles / ~10\u201320 minutes) and offered to calculate an exact route or find a different locally owned market. The final map snapshot shows the Hilton Garden Inn location, so the agent supplied the requested hotel name and a nearby local/regional supermarket with a walking-distance estimate \u2014 meeting the user's request.", "status": "success"}}
{"id": 32, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The map shows \"Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South\u2011Robinson Mall,\" so the agent did locate a Hilton hotel. However the final page snapshot does not display any walking route or distance information to a supermarket, nor any confirmation that the chosen supermarket is the nearest one owned by a local company. Although the action history indicates the agent searched for \"Giant Eagle Robinson Mall\" and selected Foot (OSRM), the final state lacks the route/distance output required by the user and does not verify local ownership. Therefore the task requirements (hotel name plus walking distance to the nearest locally\u2011owned supermarket) were not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
