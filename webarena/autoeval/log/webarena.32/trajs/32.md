## Intent

I will arrive Pittsburgh Airport soon. Provide the name of a Hilton hotel in the vicinity, if available. Then, tell me the the walking distance to the nearest supermarket own by a local company from the hotel.

## RM

Thoughts: The map shows "Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South‑Robinson Mall," so the agent did locate a Hilton hotel. However the final page snapshot does not display any walking route or distance information to a supermarket, nor any confirmation that the chosen supermarket is the nearest one owned by a local company. Although the action history indicates the agent searched for "Giant Eagle Robinson Mall" and selected Foot (OSRM), the final state lacks the route/distance output required by the user and does not verify local ownership. Therefore the task requirements (hotel name plus walking distance to the nearest locally‑owned supermarket) were not completed.
Status: "failure"
