## Captions

===============INFO - I will follow the saved sequence in Memory 1: search → open item → add to wish list, because that reliably finds and bookmarks items. Memory 2 (cardinal directions for neighbors) is irrelevant for this shopping task, so I will not use it. Memory 3 (how to enter sidebar/list items) is also not relevant here, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory check:
