## Intent

Invite Abishek and Vinta as collaborator to a11yproject.com repo

## RM

Thoughts: The final screenshot shows the "Invite members" modal with the username/email input empty and the Invite button not confirmed as clicked. The action log shows only a single fill('638', 'Abishek') earlier and no actions entering "Vinta" or successfully clicking "Invite" to send invitations. Because neither both usernames were entered nor the invite submitted, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"
