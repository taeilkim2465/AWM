## Intent

Add a toothpaste to my wish list.

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a green confirmation message explicitly stating the toothpaste (Baking Soda Whitening Toothpaste...) "has been added to your Wish List." The My Wish List page is displayed with 6 items, indicating the wish list was updated. These confirm the agent successfully added the toothpaste to the wish list.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide my approach:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to pick a clear product from the search results (refine/pick a distinct item). Memory 2 (go to dedicated list page) is not needed because the user asked to add an item, not view the list. Memory 3's sequence (search → open item → add to wish list) is helpful; however a visible "Add to Wish List" button is already available on the result tile, so I'll add the first toothpaste directly from the search results to the wish list to complete the user's request quickly.
