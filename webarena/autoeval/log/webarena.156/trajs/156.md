## Intent

Checkout merge requests assigned to me

## RM

Thoughts: The final page is the GitLab "Merge requests" view with the filter "Assignee = Byte Blaze" applied and it shows three open merge requests (Add verification functions; update or remove 404 links; feat: add WCAG levels). This matches the user's intent to check merge requests assigned to them, so the navigation succeeded.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will consider the provided memories before acting.
