## Intent

Find the page of the college(s) where The Chair was filmed in Pennsylvania other than the ones in Pittsburgh on the map.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the search box and clicked but the final snapshot shows only the default world map with no search results, markers, or college pages displayed. The user's request (find the page(s) of Pennsylvania college(s) where The Chair was filmed, excluding Pittsburgh ones) was not satisfied and no results or explicit "not found" message is shown. Therefore the task failed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (record provenance and exact quotes) — not relevant to this step; I'm searching for filming-location pages on the map, not extracting reviewer quotes. I will not use it.
