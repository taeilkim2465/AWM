The agent's actions repeatedly filled the Nominatim search box and clicked, but the final page shows only a global map with no search results, no identified Cold Stone location, and no routing or travel-time information. Nominatim is a geocoding service and does not provide drive-time calculations; the agent did not locate a specific Cold Stone or call a routing service to get duration. Therefore the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
