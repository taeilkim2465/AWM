## Intent

I am at CMU Pittsburgh, how long it takes to drive to the nearest cold stone ice cream

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for driving time from CMU (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh) to the nearest Cold Stone. The agent's actions repeatedly filled the Nominatim search box and clicked, but the final page shows only a global map with no search results, no identified Cold Stone location, and no routing or travel-time information. Nominatim is a geocoding service and does not provide drive-time calculations; the agent did not locate a specific Cold Stone or call a routing service to get duration. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will try a different search query because the first Nominatim search returned "No results found".
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will present a clear conclusion and nearest match details if the search returns no direct matches within a reasonable driving distance.
===============INFO - Memory review:
