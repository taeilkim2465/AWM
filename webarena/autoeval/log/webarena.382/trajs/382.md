## Intent

I am arriving at Carnegie Mellon University. Find the nearby US Citizenship and Immigration Services and the walking distance to the nearest Social Security Administration from US Citizenship and Immigration Services

## RM

Thoughts: The agent repeatedly searched for USCIS/USCIS field office variants but the final OpenStreetMap Nominatim results pane shows "No results found" and the map is centered on Carnegie Mellon; no USCIS location or Social Security Administration location was identified and no walking distance was computed. Because this is an information-seeking task and the required information (USCIS location and walking distance to the nearest SSA) was not found or reported, the task failed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Compute routed walking times to several candidate POIs) because I should collect candidate USCIS locations near Carnegie Mellon and compute actual walking routes/times rather than relying on a single result. I will not use Memory 2 (driving distance to airports) because it's not relevant. I will not use Memory 3 (national park clarification) because it's unrelated.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It advises computing routed walking times to multiple candidate POIs rather than relying on a single search result; that's needed after I find nearby USCIS locations so I can compute accurate walking distance/time to the nearest SSA.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The user asked for walking distance, so I should compute actual walking routes and times to nearby SSA candidates (not rely on straight-line distance).
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (compute routed walking times to candidate POIs) because I should compute an actual walking route/time between the USCIS office and the nearest Social Security Administration rather than relying on straight-line distance. I will not use Memory 2 (driving to airports) or Memory 3 (clarify "National Park") because they're not relevant.
===============INFO - Memory items:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Compute routed walking times to several candidate POIs) because the user asked for walking distance between two government offices; I should gather candidate POIs and then compute an actual walking route/time rather than relying on straight-line distance. I will not use Memory 2 (driving to airports) — it's irrelevant. I will not use Memory 3 (national park clarification) — also irrelevant.
