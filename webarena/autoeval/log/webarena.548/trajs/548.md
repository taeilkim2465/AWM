## Intent

Add a new color blue to size S and M of Frankie Sweatshirt

## RM

Thoughts: The action history and final screenshot show the agent is on "Step 3: Bulk Images, Price and Quantity" of the Create Product Configurations flow and it indicates "Based on your selections 2 new products will be created." However the agent has not clicked the Next/Finish to reach the Summary or confirm creation, and the page does not show the actual SKUs or a confirmation that the new blue color was added to sizes S and M. There is no visible selection or final save confirming the change. Therefore the requested content modification was not completed.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it explicitly reminds me to set the variant scope (select specific sizes) before adding a color so the new option is applied only to the intended size variants. I will not use Memory 2 (commerce signals) for this UI action — it's about marketing context, not needed now. I will not use Memory 3 (no-results fallback) — it relates to searches returning no results, which doesn't apply at this step.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Set the variant scope...): I will use this memory — it's important to ensure the color option is added to the correct size-specific variant group (S and M) later when editing the product.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Set the variant scope) — I will use this. It's important to select the size (variant scope) S and M in the product editor before adding the new color so the color option is added only to those sizes, not globally.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 is relevant and I will use it: I should set the variant scope to only sizes S and M before adding the color so the blue color is applied only to those sizes (not globally or to other sizes).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1: "Set the variant scope (e.g., specific size) before adding an attribute like color." Yes — that is relevant because I need to make sure the color Blue is applied only to the S and M sizes, so I should go back to the Attribute Values step to scope values per size before creating the SKUs.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Set the variant scope before adding an attribute) — USE. This is directly relevant: I can see S and M are already selected under Size and Blue is selected under Color, so the variant scope is set correctly before creating the configurations.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1: Yes — it reminds me to set the variant scope (select the target sizes S and M) before adding a new color option so the new color applies only to those sizes. Memory 2: No — pricing/commerce signals are not needed for adding a color option. Memory 3: No — no "no results" fallback logic is relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Set the variant scope before adding an attribute) is relevant — I will rely on it because Size S and M are already selected so adding/creating the Blue variant will apply to those sizes. Memory 2 (commerce signals) is not needed for this UI action. Memory 3 (no-results fallback) is not relevant.
