## Intent

Which US states border Pennsylvania?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent answered the user's question by listing six states: New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Ohio. That list is correct for the states that border Pennsylvania, so the information-seeking task was completed successfully. The webpage snapshot is irrelevant to the correctness of the answer.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Pennsylvania borders 6 states:\n1. New York\n2. New Jersey\n3. Delaware\n4. Maryland\n5. West Virginia\n6. Ohio"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (explicit list of land neighbors): I will use this — it matches the user's request to list bordering states.
