{"id": 525, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked the agent to \"Star the top four most stared repos in Gitlab\" but the agent's last actions only navigated and asked a clarification (scope and which account to use). There is no evidence the agent identified the top-4 projects, navigated to those project pages, or clicked the star buttons. The final snapshot shows a starrers list (and that the logged-in user is \"It's you\"), not the top-starred projects or any starred actions having been performed. Asking for clarification is reasonable, but the requested action was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
