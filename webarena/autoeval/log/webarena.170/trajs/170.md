## Intent

Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got the least stars?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent inspected the Contributed projects tab (action history and the final page show the "Contributed projects" tab active and the message "Explore public groups to find projects to contribute to."), found no contributed repositories to rank by stars, and explicitly told the user that no contributed projects were found and offered clear next actions. For an information-seeking task, explicitly stating the information is not available satisfies the requirement. Therefore the execution succeeded.

Status: "success"

## Final Response "I checked your Contributed projects tab — it’s active but shows no contributed projects, so I can’t find any repositories to rank by star count. Would you like me to: 1

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter contributed repos and sort by star count): I will use this — the task is to find repositories the user contributed to and identify those with the least stars, so the approach of restricting to contributed repos and using star counts is relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter contributed repositories and sort by star count): I will use this — the task specifically asks for repos the user contributed to and sorted by lowest stars, so I need to restrict to contributed repositories and sort by star count.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Filter contributed repositories and sort by star count): I will use this. The task requires restricting to repos the user contributed to and sorting by stars to find the least-starred ones.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter contributed repos & sort by stars) — I will use this. The task specifically asks about repositories the user contributed to and their star counts, sorted to find the least-starred.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will not use this now — it describes sorting contributed repos by stars, but I can't apply it because the "Contributed projects" view is currently empty.
