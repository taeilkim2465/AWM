## Intent

Show me the "mouth night guard" listings by descending price.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent selected "Price" as the sort key and the page snapshot shows "Sort By Price" with a downward arrow and "Items 1–12 of 9819", indicating results are sorted by price in descending order. The agent also reported the top item price and offered next actions. This satisfies the user's request to show the listings by descending price.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "The results are already sorted by Price in descending order (high → low
