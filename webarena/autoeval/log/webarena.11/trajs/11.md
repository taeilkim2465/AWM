## Intent

Tell me the the number of reviews that our store received by far that mention term "disappointed"

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The snapshot shows the Review filter contains "disappointed" and the table displays two matching rows with IDs 353 and 351; the page indicator shows 1 of 1 (no additional pages). The agent reported "2 reviews" and listed IDs 353 and 351, which matches the page state, so the agent's response is correct and complete.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'I found 2 reviews that mention "disappointed": IDs 353 and 351. I checked the Reviews table on page 1 (only page

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Exhaustively traverse paginated reviews) — I will use this. I must check all review pages (or determine total pages) before concluding the count.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Exhaustively traverse paginated reviews): I will use this — we must check all review pages before reporting the final count.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Exhaustively traverse paginated reviews) is relevant — I will use it because to be complete I must search across all pages (or use the grid filter to find all matching reviews before concluding).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (exhaustively check pagination) because I must ensure we scanned all review pages before concluding. I will not use Memory 2 (vote net scores) because votes are irrelevant to counting mentions of "disappointed". I will use Memory 3 (scan Reviews area and report matches) to explicitly identify which reviews mention the term.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Exhaustively traverse paginated reviews): Use. The page shows pagination "1 of 1", but I should still follow the memory rule and confirm there is only one page after applying the filter.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Exhaustively traverse paginated reviews): I will use this — the page shows "of 1" (single page), so I should confirm I checked the whole set before reporting.
