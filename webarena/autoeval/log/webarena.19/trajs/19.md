## Intent

Compare the time for walking and driving route from Carnegie Science Center to Carnegie Mellon University

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows only the walking directions (Distance 7.8 km, Time 1:44). Although the action history includes switching to Car (OSRM) earlier, the final state and provided content do not show a driving travel time, and no explicit comparison or statement that driving time is unavailable was returned. Because the user asked to compare walking and driving times and the agent did not present both times or explicitly say one is unavailable, the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use walking-mode routing and compare walking distance/time — Yes. The page already shows walking results (Distance: 7.8km. Time: 1:44.), so I'll keep that as the walking baseline.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — the user specifically asked for walking vs driving times; I'll use walking-mode routing to get an accurate walking estimate (not straight-line or driving-based).
===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The user asked for walking vs driving times, so I should get the walking-mode routing (not just straight-line) and compare walking time/route. I'll use the walking profile to compute realistic walking time.
