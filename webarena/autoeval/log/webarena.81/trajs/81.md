## Intent

What is the duration required to first walk from Univ of Pittsburgh to starbucks on Craig Street, and then drive to Pittsburgh International Airport?

## RM

Thoughts: The map only shows a single leg with Distance: 0m and Time: 0:00 (and steps "Start on South Craig Street" / "Reach destination"), and there is no computed walking leg from University of Pittsburgh to the Starbucks nor any nonzero duration for the drive to Pittsburgh International Airport. The agent repeatedly toggled travel modes and filled inputs but never produced the two-leg durations requested. Therefore it did not provide the required duration information.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use memory items 2 and 3 (prefer pedestrian routing profile) because the first leg is a walk and pedestrian routing gives more accurate walking times. I will not use Memory 1 (airport candidate enumeration) because the user already specified Pittsburgh International Airport as the destination for the driving leg.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (enumerating nearby airports) because the user already specified a particular airport (Pittsburgh International Airport), so there's no need to search for candidate airports.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 and 3 (prefer pedestrian routing for walking) because the user asked for the walking time for the first leg; the current page already used the Foot (OSRM) profile and shows the walking result (Distance 1.4 km, Time 0:18). I will not use Memory 1 (enumerate nearby airports) because the user specified Pittsburgh International Airport specifically, so there's no need to search candidate airports.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Enumerate candidate airports): I will not use this — it's about gathering multiple airports and filtering by distance, which is unnecessary for this two-leg duration query.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3 because they advise using a pedestrian/walking routing profile for walking-duration estimates — that matches the user's first-leg request. I will not use Memory 1 (enumerating airports) because the user already specified Pittsburgh International Airport and I only need the driving duration to that known airport.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (enumerate candidate airports) — I will not use this. The user asked about a specific airport (Pittsburgh International) so we don't need to enumerate candidates.
