## Intent

What is the phone number of Carnegie Mellon Café

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent searched the OpenStreetMap/Nominatim results, found "No results found" and inspected the page (search box, header, map, footer) and explicitly reported that no phone number or contact info was present, then offered next steps. Because the agent either provided the requested information or explicitly stated it was not available on the page, the execution meets the success criteria.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I checked this OpenStreetMap/Nominatim search page and did not find a phone number.\n\nWhat I inspected: \n- Search box / search results panel (the query returned ‘No results found’

===============INFO - I will use the page search box to look up the Carnegie Mellon Café and find its phone number on the OpenStreetMap entry or linked details.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it — it tells me to report what I inspected and give next steps if no phone is found. I already checked the OpenStreetMap search results panel (header/search area and results list) and it showed "No results found".
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. The current OpenStreetMap search returned no results, so I should report exactly which areas I inspected and offer next steps (per Memory 1).
===============INFO - I inspected the page areas visible so far: the search box (it's filled with "Carnegie Mellon University café phone"), the Search Results panel on the left (shows "No results found" from OpenStreetMap Nominatim), the header/navigation, and the map area. I did not see any phone number on this page.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to report what I've inspected and propose clear next steps. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 right now because I haven't found any phone number on this page yet (so normalizing phone formats or checking customer-record fields isn't applicable yet).
