## Intent

Show me the walking distance from nearby hotels to CMU, Pittsburgh that take at most 5 minutes?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for walking distances from nearby hotels to Carnegie Mellon University that take at most 5 minutes. The action log shows repeated searches and selecting "Foot (OSRM)" but the final page snapshot shows the route panel with From/To fields empty and no computed routes or list of hotels with walking times. The agent did not produce any distances nor filter hotels by ≤5 minutes, so the requested information was not provided.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items to guide the search and routing:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the located hotel as the origin for targeted nearby-amenity searches — I will use this. Once I find hotel candidates, I'll center searches/directions on each hotel's location.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1, Memory 2, or Memory 3 yet because they all presume we already have one or more specific hotels identified as origins. Right now the OpenStreetMap search returned "No results found" for my previous query, so first I need to get usable search results (a list of hotels or the campus location) before applying those memories to compute walking times.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the located hotel as the origin for targeted nearby-amenity searches" — I will use this. Once I find a hotel I should use it as the origin for precise walking routes to CMU.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they are directly relevant: they recommend using each hotel's location as the origin and using a pedestrian routing profile to get accurate walking times.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (use a pedestrian routing profile) because we should compute walking times with a foot/pedestrian profile — I previously selected "Foot (OSRM)" so the routing results will be pedestrian times. I will not directly use Memory 1 or Memory 2 right now (they recommend using each hotel as the origin for targeted nearby searches) because first I need to get the list of nearby hotels; once I have candidates I'll use each hotel's address/POI as the origin for precise walking directions to CMU.
