Thoughts: The user asked to find a bar near Carnegie Music Hall.

The agent reported that name and offered follow-up actions (open details, directions, more bars), satisfying the user's request to find the bar.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'The map shows "Alcohol House" immediately adjacent to Carnegie Music Hall / Carnegie Library — that appears to be the bar you asked about. Would you like me to open its details, find directions there, or look for other nearby bars?'
