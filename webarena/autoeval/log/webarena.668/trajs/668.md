## Intent

Submit a merge request for a11yproject.com/redesign branch to be merged into master branch, assign Justin Armstrong as the reviewer

## RM

Thoughts: This was a content-modification task (create a merge request and assign a reviewer). The action log only shows filtering/searching for the source branch (fill + Enter) and several clicks, but no actions creating a new merge request, selecting target branch, submitting the MR, or assigning Justin Armstrong as reviewer. The final snapshot is the project's Merge requests list (no new MR detail open and no reviewer assignment visible), so the requested MR was not created/assigned.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Assign reviewers from the MR form) because once the branches are set and the MR form opens I should add Justin Armstrong via the reviewer/requested-reviewers control.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (Assign reviewers directly from the MR form) because it describes the exact control to add Justin Armstrong as a reviewer when creating the MR.
===============INFO - I will first use Memory 2 (check for an existing merge request) to avoid creating a duplicate MR for the same source→target branches. Memory 1 (how to assign reviewers from the MR form) is also relevant later when creating the MR, so I'll keep it in mind, but I will not use Memory 3 right now.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Assign reviewers directly from the merge request form): I will use this. Once we reach the MR creation page I will focus the reviewer/requested-reviewers control and add Justin Armstrong there.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Assign reviewers from MR form): I'll use this later after I open or create the MR so I can add Justin Armstrong via the reviewer/requested-reviewers control. So: use later — not for the immediate click.
