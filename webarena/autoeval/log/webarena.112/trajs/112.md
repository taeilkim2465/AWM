===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 and Memory 3 but not Memory 1.
===============INFO - I will use the admin "All Reviews" view to find reviewers who complained about the product "Circe fleece".
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Include explicit reply instructions..." — I will NOT use this memory. It is a general UI reply template guideline and doesn't add value for extracting reviewer data from the page.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (explicit reply instructions): I will not use this—it's not needed for locating reviewers.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Include explicit reply instructions) — I will not use this memory. It isn't needed for extracting review details from the page.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Include explicit reply instructions..." — I will not use this memory for the UI action because it's about reply formatting and not needed for navigating the admin UI now.
===============INFO - Memory1: I will not use this — it's about formatting reply instructions and isn't needed for extracting reviewer details.
