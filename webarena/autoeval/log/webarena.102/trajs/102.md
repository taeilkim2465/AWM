## Intent

Display the list of issues in the a11yproject/a11yproject.com repository that have labels related to help needed

Thoughts: The agent applied the label filter (label:"help wanted" OR label:"good first issue"), read the current issues list, and returned the matching issues it found on the current view (#1521, #1478, #1419). It also offered clear next steps to show more results, increase items per page, or export the full filtered list. This satisfies the user's request to display issues with help-related labels (and indicates how to retrieve the full set if more exist), so the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

I will not use Memory 3 because it is about recording reviewer quotes and is not relevant to listing issues.
===============INFO - I will navigate to the project's Issues page to list issues with "help needed" (or related) labels.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the dedicated list page): Use — we're already on the project's Issues list, so this confirms we're on the right page.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the dedicated list page for "view my items" requests): I will use this memory because the issues list page is the correct dedicated page to view issues, and we're already on it. This confirms we should extract data from this list view.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the dedicated list page) — I will not use this. We're already on the repository's Issues list page, so navigating elsewhere isn't needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the dedicated list page): I will use this — we are already on the Issues "List" page, which is the right place to view the repository issues.
