## Intent

Gather the titles of Doc and Pies Arcade Factory Cocktail Arcade Machine reviews with 3 stars and less rating from OneStopShop, and post them in the games subreddit under the title "real user feedback on Doc and Pies Arcade Factory Cocktail Arcade Machine"

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows one 3-star review titled "Based arrived broken but game itself works" but the agent did not collect all potentially relevant reviews (there is a second page of reviews) and there is no evidence in the action history that the agent posted anything to the games subreddit under the requested title. Because the required posting step (and likely full collection across pages) was not completed, the task failed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (yes) because it reminds me to apply review filters and confirm I'm extracting review titles with the right rating range. Memory 2 is not relevant (no). Memory 3 (yes) is useful for composing the Reddit post once I have the review titles.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use site review filters and confirm extraction targets — I will use this. It reminds me to look for rating filters or rating labels on each review and to extract the review titles (not metadata). The reviews tab likely shows ratings per review that I can filter or at least inspect and programmatically filter by rating.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — it reminds me to apply review filters or paginate and confirm I extract the review titles and ratings. This page doesn't show a built-in rating filter, so I should paginate and collect reviews from all pages, then filter by rating (3 stars or less = 60% or below). I'll use that approach.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Use site review filters and confirm extraction targets) because it reminds me to filter or navigate reviews and to extract the review titles (summaries) for ratings <= 3 stars. Memory 2 is not relevant (it's about repositories). Memory 3 (Compose community posts) is somewhat relevant for later when posting to Reddit, but right now my immediate task is to gather the low-rated review titles from OneStopShop, so I won't use Memory 3 yet.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use site review filters and confirm extraction targets): I will use this — it reminds me to filter/paginate and to extract the review titles and ratings correctly. On this page there is pagination (Page 2 link) so I should navigate to the next page to capture all low-rated reviews.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it reminds me to use the site's review pagination/filtering and to extract review titles and ratings (relevant for collecting reviews with 3 stars or less). Memory 2 is not relevant (it's about GitHub repos). Memory 3 (post composition guidance) is useful later when I create the Reddit post, but not needed for this navigation step.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to apply site filters or otherwise ensure I'm capturing review titles for ratings of 3 stars or less — the page doesn't offer a visible rating filter, so I'll need to inspect all review pages and pick titles whose rating corresponds to 3 stars (60%) or lower (20%, 40%, etc.). I will also use Memory 3 later to compose the subreddit post with a concise title and context. I will not use Memory 2 because it's unrelated (it concerns repo contributions).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use site review filters and confirm extraction targets): I will use this memory. It reminds me to use the site's pagination/filters to find low-rated reviews and to extract the review titles (not metadata). The page has pagination controls, so I'll navigate pages to collect all reviews with rating 3 stars or less.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use site review filters/pagination) because the reviews span multiple pages and I need to collect all reviews with 3 stars or less. Memory 2 (filter contributed repos) is irrelevant to this task, so I will not use it. Memory 3 (compose community posts) is useful for when I prepare the Reddit post content, but right now my immediate need is to navigate to page 2 of the reviews to gather any remaining low-rated review titles.
