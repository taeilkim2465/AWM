What are the top-2 best-selling product in 2022

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the top‑2 best‑selling products in 2022. The agent ran the Bestsellers report for 1/1/22–12/31/22 and returned a clear #1 (Quest Lumaflex™ Band — 5 orders) and explicitly noted a three‑way tie for #2 by quantity (three products with 4 orders each). The agent also provided a reasonable tie‑break by revenue and the resulting ordering. This directly answers the information‑seeking request and explains ambiguity/tie‑breaking options, so the task is successful.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the Reports menu to find the bestsellers report where I can select the year (2022) and get the top-selling products.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (Always offer clear next-step actions after a summary) because after I retrieve the bestsellers report I should propose follow-ups (like setting the date range to 2022 or exporting).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Offer next-step options when no matches are found): I will not use this now — first I should try to generate the report for 2022 on this page. If no records are found, I can apply Memory 1 later to propose follow-ups.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (offer next-step options when no matches found): Not needed — the report already shows results.
