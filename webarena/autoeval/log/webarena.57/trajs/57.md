## Intent

Tell me the closest restaurant(s) to university center at Carnegie Mellon University

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the closest restaurant(s) to the University Center at Carnegie Mellon. The action history shows repeated searches, but the final page snapshot still shows a world map with "Loading data from API..." and no search results, no POI markers or list of nearby restaurants visible. The agent did not return the requested restaurant information or indicate it was unavailable, so the task was not completed. 
Status: "failure"
