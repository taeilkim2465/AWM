## Intent

Change the delivery address for my most recent order to 4000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the Address Book page (the final page shows Default Shipping Address still as 222 Redwood Rise, Seattle). There is a "Change Shipping Address" link visible but no evidence the shipping address was edited or saved to the requested 4000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA. Because the displayed address remains unchanged, the delivery address was not updated for the order (and if the site requires changing the order's delivery separately, that was not done either). 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it directly describes how to find the user's most recent order with a "processing" status by going to the account/orders page and scanning Recent Orders. I will not use Memory 2 (filter/sort for "Pending") because the user asked to change the delivery address for the most recent order (not specifically pending), and Memory 1 is a better match. I will not use Memory 3 (compare cancelled orders) since there's no indication the most recent order is cancelled.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide which order to act on.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Locate the most recent order with a 'processing' status" — I will not use this. The current order page is already open and the order status is "Pending", so we don't need to search for a processing order.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Locate the most recent order with a "processing" status): I will use this — the task asks to change the delivery address for the most recent order, so I need to find that order (likely one with "processing" or similar status).
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (locate most recent processing order): Not useful — the current order is "Pending" and I'm already viewing Order #000000189, so I won't use this memory.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Locate the most recent order with a 'processing' status" — I will use this. It directly describes how to find the most recent processing order and tells me to go to the account/orders page and scan the orders list. That matches the next step I need to take.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It tells me to look for the most recent order with a "processing" status; on this page the equivalent status shown is "Pending", so I'll use that to pick the most recent pending order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Locate the most recent order with a 'processing' status" — I will use this memory item as a guide to confirm we're working on the user's most recent active order. The current page shows Order #000000189 with status "Pending" (an active order) and the order date, so this appears to be the most recent active order. Using Memory 1 is helpful to confirm we're on the right order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to find the user's most recent order with a processing/pending status. I can see the current page is Order #000000189 and its status is "Pending", so this is likely the most recent processing order to update.
