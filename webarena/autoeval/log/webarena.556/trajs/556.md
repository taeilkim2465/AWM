===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - We need to create a new repository and add a README listing Christopher Nolan movies.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Create a folder and file in a repo by using the file-creation path" — I will not use this memory right now. It's useful later if I need to add a new file inside a nested folder, but for now I only need to create the project and its README.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (file-creation path): Not needed — the repository and README already exist, and I plan to edit the existing README rather than create nested folders or files.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (create nested file via path): Not needed now — the README was already created in a previous step.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (create nested file via file-creation path): Not needed — the README has already been created in the repository and a merge request exists to add/update it.
