## Intent

Update the description of Lucia Cross-Fit Bra to highlight the real user positive reviews by quoting the comments

## RM

Thoughts: The agent edited the product description field twice to include a "Real customers say:" section with quoted blockquote comments, then submitted/saved the changes (press/Enter actions and final save click). There are no error messages in the final page snapshot and the product edit page is displayed, indicating the update was applied. The change matches the user's intent to highlight real user positive reviews by quoting the comments.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows before editing the product:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it recommends embedding short verbatim review quotes with attribution, which I should follow when updating the product description.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as follows before editing the product description:
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories to guide the edit:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they recommend embedding short, attributed verbatim review excerpts (one- to two-line quotes) and separating functional details — that matches the user's request to highlight real-user positive reviews by quoting comments. I will also use Memory 3 to verify review availability before editing: I can see 3 approved product reviews in the Product Reviews section (including at least two that contain positive or mixed-but-positive lines such as "Comfy though." and "I did like it in the end."), so there are suitable short excerpts to quote. To edit the product description I'll open the Description editor — the "Edit with Page Builder" button is the right control to modify the description field.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Embed short verbatim quotes with clear attribution): I will use this — it matches the user's request to highlight real user praise with short quoted excerpts and attribution in the description.
===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide the edit and save approach:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It directly matches the requested style (short verbatim quotes with attribution). I used this guidance when adding blockquoted review lines with reviewer name and date.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 (yes) because they recommend embedding short, attributed verbatim quotes from real reviews — that's exactly what the user asked. I will also reference Memory 3 (yes) to note we should verify review availability/permissions; we previously used two review excerpts (Maribel, Krystina) so I'll proceed using short, attributed quotes and keep product details in bullets for readability.
