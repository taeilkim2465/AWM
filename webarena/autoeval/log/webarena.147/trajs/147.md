What is the size configuration of the picture frame I bought 2022

## RM

Thoughts: The agent reached an order details page (Order #000000162, dated Dec 12, 2022) but the Items Ordered shown is "Whole Foods Market, Bread Batard Olive, 19 Ounce" — not a picture frame and there is no size/configuration information visible on the page. For an information-seeking task about the size configuration of a picture frame bought in 2022, the required information is not present in the final page snapshot, so the agent did not successfully retrieve the requested detail.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I'll try to find the order/details for the picture frame by opening the account page where order history is usually available.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories as follows before proceeding:
===============INFO - I will consider the memory items before acting.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because when I get to the list of orders it's helpful to set the page size to the maximum so I don't miss older orders (this reduces pagination). I will use Memory 2 to present clear next steps to the user after I find the orders. I will keep Memory 3 in mind as a fallback in case the orders list or item details are inaccessible, so I can explain what I checked and offer next steps.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 to increase results per page so I can see older orders (including 2022) without paging — this is relevant and should reduce navigation. I will not need Memory 3 right now because data should be accessible once more orders are shown; I'll keep it in mind if I can't find the order. I will plan to use Memory 2 after I find the order to offer clear next-step choices to you.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - I will try to find the order that contains the "2022# Reasoning Memories" picture frame.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Increase results‑per‑page): I will use this. Showing more orders per page (50) should surface older 2022 orders (there are 37 total) so I can find the order that contains "Reasoning Memories" without extra pagination.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Increase results‑per‑page): I used this earlier (the page is already set to 50 per page) so I will not re-use it now.
