## Intent

Tell me the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Sorrells Library

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Sorrells Library (an information-seeking task). The agent only performed a place search for "Sorrells Library Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA" and the final page shows a world map with a "Loading data from API ..." banner and no list of nearby restaurants or POI results. The agent did not retrieve or present any restaurant names/addresses nor explicitly state that such information isn't available. Because the required information was not provided and no successful nearby-restaurant query was completed, the task failed.
Status: "failure"
