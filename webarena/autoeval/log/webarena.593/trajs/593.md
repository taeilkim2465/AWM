## Intent

Create a milestone for the upcoming task of merging all branches to main starting on March 15, 2044 and ending on March 30, 2044

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent filled the milestone title and start/end dates and clicked to create it. The page snapshot displays the milestone "Merge all branches to main" with Start date Mar 15, 2044 and Due date Mar 30, 2044 (Upcoming), confirming the milestone was created correctly.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The user gave explicit start and end dates (March 15, 2044 to March 30, 2044). Per Memory 1, I should map those directly to milestone start and due fields (start = 2044-03-15, due = 2044-03-30) and ensure inclusive boundaries to avoid off-by-one errors.
