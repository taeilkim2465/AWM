## Intent

Promote koush/AndroidAsync to subreddit funny with the description from the repo itself.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the URL, title, body and selected the "funny" subreddit, then attempted to create the submission but the page displays the error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." which prevents creating the submission. The agent correctly reported the error and offered next steps to the user, but the actual promotion (posting) was not completed. 
Status: "failure"
