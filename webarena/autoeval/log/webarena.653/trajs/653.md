## Intent

Fill the "contact us" form in the site for a refund on the phone screen protector I bought, stating that it broke after just three days of use. Also, ensure to include the order number #000000180 and the product SKU. Don't submit yet, I will check.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the contact message and included order #000000180, then stopped before submitting as requested. However the message still contains the placeholder "[INSERT SKU]" and the agent asked the user to provide the product SKU instead of filling it. Because the user explicitly asked the agent to include the product SKU in the form before stopping, the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I’m ready to fill the Contact Us form with the refund request. Please tell me the product SKU you want included (I will include order #000000180

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (it advises to be concise about the defect, timeframe, refund requested, offer evidence and ask about returns) because it directly helps compose the message for the refund request. I will NOT use Memory 1 or Memory 2 because those are about locating phone numbers and reporting inspection steps, which aren't needed for filling the contact form.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (report inspected areas & next steps): Not needed for this step — it's about reporting phone-number search locations.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this — it reminds me to report which sections I inspect (header, contact form, footer, account links) if we don't find a direct contact method.
===============INFO - I will use the account memories to guide the next steps:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (report inspected areas) — I will not use this memory now because we aren't searching the page for a phone number or troubleshooting a missing contact option; the Contact Us page is already present and accessible.
