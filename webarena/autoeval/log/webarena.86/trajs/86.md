## Intent

From my stay at La Quinta Inn near the airport, what's the estimated driving time to reach Upitt?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent correctly asked a needed clarification (which La Quinta and which Upitt) before computing driving time, and the page snapshot shows the directions form is empty (no route calculated). The user’s requested information (estimated driving time) was not provided and no directions were run. Because the task result must return the driving time or explicitly state it's unavailable, this execution is incomplete and therefore a failure.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Quick question before I look it up: do you mean the La Quinta Inn near Pittsburgh International Airport, and by “Upitt” the University of Pittsburgh (main campus in Oakland, Pittsburgh

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to report both distance and estimated driving duration, which the user asked for.
===============INFO - Memory 1, 2, 3: I will use all three. They tell me to return both distance and estimated driving time, mention the primary route and the routing/data source, and warn that times vary with traffic — all useful and appropriate for this driving-time query.
