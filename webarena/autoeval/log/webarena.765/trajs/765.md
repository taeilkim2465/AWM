## Intent

Find the walkway to the closest Japanese food market from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the walkway to the closest Japanese food market from 401 Shady Ave. The action history shows repeated searches and the travel mode set to "Foot (OSRM)" with start and destination fields filled, but the final map snapshot only shows the start pin (Kenmawr Apartments) and a labeled destination text in the input pane — no walking route or directions are displayed on the map and no confirmation that a specific Japanese market was located. Because the agent did not produce a walking route or explicitly identify the nearest Japanese market or state that none exists, it did not complete the user's request.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use walking/pedestrian routing) because the user specifically asked for the walkway to a market and pedestrian routing yields walkway-specific directions. I will also use Memory 3 (broaden category terms) to search for "Japanese market" and related terms (e.g., "Japanese grocery" / "Asian market") if needed to ensure we find specialty markets. I will NOT use Memory 2 because it relates to transaction/category filtering and is irrelevant.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the correct routing profile for walkways — I will use this memory. I need to ensure the walking/pedestrian profile is selected before generating directions so the route shows walkways and sidewalks.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because the directions should be in walking/pedestrian mode so the route shows walkways and sidewalks. I will not use Memory 2 because it concerns transaction categories and is unrelated. I will use Memory 3: if a strict "Japanese market" search returns no results, I should try broader/related terms (e.g., "Asian grocery", "Japanese grocery", "Japanese supermarket") to find nearby specialty stores.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use the walking routing profile) because we need walkway-specific directions. I will not use Memory 2 (transaction/category filtering) — it's not relevant. I will not use Memory 3 (broader category terms) for now, but I may expand the search term later if no Japanese market appears.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use? Yes. It says to select the pedestrian/walking routing mode. The page already has "Foot (OSRM)" selected, so the walking profile is in place — this is relevant and satisfied.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because the Foot (OSRM) routing profile is required for walkway-specific directions — the page already has "Foot (OSRM)" selected. I will not use Memory 2 (transaction/category filtering) because it's irrelevant to finding a market. I will keep Memory 3 in mind (use broader category terms) in case the search for a Japanese-specific market fails; currently the "To" field is set to "Asian grocery Shadyside Pittsburgh", which is a good broader term.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the correct routing profile for walkways): I will use this — the "Foot (OSRM)" profile is already selected in the route form, so pedestrian routing is set correctly.
