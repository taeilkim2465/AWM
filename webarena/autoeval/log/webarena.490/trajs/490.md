## Intent

Change the page title of "About us" page on my site to "Secret".

## RM

Thoughts: The page header shows "Secret", the Page Title input contains "Secret", and there is a green confirmation message "You saved the page." These indicate the agent successfully updated and saved the About Us page title to "Secret".
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they describe the exact procedure needed: open the page editor for the target page, edit the Title field, and save. Memory 1, Memory 2, and Memory 3 are all relevant and reinforce the same steps (open editor, change title input, save). The current page shows the "Select" dropdown for the "About us" row with an "Edit" link available (bid 1605). The next step is to open the page editor by clicking that "Edit" link.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it directly describes replacing the title in the page editor and saving; matches what I need to do.
