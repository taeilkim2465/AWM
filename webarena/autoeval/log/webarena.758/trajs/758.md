## Intent

Show me the path and travel time from the big apple to biggest city in Maine.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent entered "New York, NY" and "Portland, Maine", clicked to get directions, and the final page shows a plotted route with step-by-step directions and summary: Distance: 508 km, Time: 6:34. This matches the user's request for the path and travel time from the Big Apple to Maine's largest city, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to populate the route fields with resolved city names (New York City and Portland, Maine). I will not use Memory 2 because the user asked for travel time (driving is the likely default) and didn't request walking; I'll stick with driving unless the routing interface asks. I'll use Memory 3 to sanity-check the travel time and distance after the route is calculated.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it tells me to populate the routing origin/destination with resolved city names to get driving time/distance — that applies directly here.
