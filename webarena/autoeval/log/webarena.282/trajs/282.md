## Intent

List the full product names of slide slippers from Nike and tell me the price range of the available products

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only reached a single product page ("Nike Men's Air Max Camden Slide Sandal" shown at $69.00) after repeated searches. The user asked for the full product names of Nike slide slippers (plural) and the price range of available products; the final page shows only one item and price, so the agent did not collect or report the full set of product names nor a price range across products. Therefore the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (use the site's search box to quickly find brand products) because searching for "Nike slide" is the fastest way to surface Nike slide slippers on this site. I will also keep Memory 1 in mind (open product pages to capture full product names) for later steps when I need complete titles and variant info, but I won't open product pages yet. Memory 2 (order-detail pricing) is not relevant at this stage.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (open product pages to capture full product names and variant info): I will use this — search result titles often truncate details, so I should open the product detail page(s) to capture the full names and any variant text.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (open product pages for full names) because the user asked for full product names and Memory 1 reminds me to open product detail pages rather than relying on truncated snippets. I will use Memory 3 (use the site's search box) because it's the fastest way to surface Nike brand slide listings on this site. I will not use Memory 2 (order-detail pricing) because it's about extracting prices from order pages, which is not relevant here.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open product pages to capture full product names and variant info): I will use this — the search results may truncate titles, so I need to open a product detail page to get the full product name and variant info.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 but not Memory 2.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (open product pages to capture full product names and variant info): I will use this — product listings can truncate titles, so I should open the product detail page to get the complete product name and variant information.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (open product pages to capture full titles) because I need full product names and variant info from each product page. I'll use Memory 3 (use the site's search box) to quickly surface Nike slide listings. I will not use Memory 2 (order detail extraction) because it's not relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (open product pages for full names/variants): I will use this — it's important to open each product detail page so I capture the complete product title and any variant details (size/colour) that might be truncated in the search listing.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I should open product detail pages to capture full product names and variant info for each Nike slide rather than relying on snippets.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (open product pages to capture full product names and variant info) — yes, because I need the complete product titles and any variant details that may be truncated in the search results.
