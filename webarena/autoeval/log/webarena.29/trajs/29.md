## Intent

Tell me the count of comments that have received more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the DIY forum.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent used the visible net score (the single number between the vote arrows) to determine whether a comment has more downvotes than upvotes. The screenshot shows the user's comments with net scores 7, 13, 12, and 281 — all positive — and the agent scrolled and stated the comment list was fully loaded. Therefore the reported count of 0 comments with more downvotes than upvotes is correct.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide how I find and count the user's downvoted comments:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2: they tell me to interpret single vote numbers as net scores (negative net => more downvotes than upvotes) and to look for expanded views or API if exact breakdown is needed. This page shows only net vote counts next to items, so I will treat negative nets as comments with more downvotes than upvotes.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to interpret single vote numbers as net scores; a negative net score means more downvotes than upvotes, which is exactly how I'll identify comments with more downvotes.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (interpret condensed vote displays as net scores): USE. The page shows a single number between the vote arrows for each comment, so a negative net would mean more downvotes than upvotes.
