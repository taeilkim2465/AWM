## Intent

From my stay at DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown, what's the estimated driving time to reach Keens Steakhouse?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for estimated driving time. The agent filled origin/destination, used Car (OSRM), and reported "distance about 6.1 km and estimated driving time ~14 minutes" plus note about the long stretch on 6th Avenue. The provided webpage snapshot shows the Directions panel with "Distance: 6.1km. Time: 0:14." and step 8 "Continue on 6th Avenue 4.1km," which matches the agent's reply. The agent returned the requested information, so the task succeeded.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories because they all instruct to report both route distance and estimated driving time (and memory 3 also asks to cite the routing source and warn about traffic variability). Using them will ensure I return the distance, an estimated driving duration, the routing source (OSRM via OpenStreetMap interface), and a short caveat.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Report both distance and estimated driving time" — I will use this. The page shows both distance and time, so I should report both.
