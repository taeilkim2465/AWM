## Intent

Rate my recent purchase of Jiffy Corn Muffin Cornbread Mix with 4 stars, using my nickname ShoppingEmma?

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent focused on the rating control and activated it (press space), filled the nickname "ShoppingEmma", added a title and review text, and clicked submit. The page snapshot displays a confirmation banner "You submitted your review for moderation," indicating the review was submitted. This satisfies the user's request to post the review (including the nickname); therefore the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 as a fallback in case the star-rating control requires keyboard focus instead of clicks. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because this task is about submitting a product review, not viewing lists or sorting orders.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (rating widgets sometimes need focus/keyboard) because star controls can be finicky — if clicking the stars later doesn't register, I'll focus the rating control and use keyboard input to set 4 stars. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 (they're about list pages and sorting orders, which are not relevant here).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Interact with star-rating controls via focus/keyboard): I will use this. The rating widget can sometimes require focus + keyboard (Space) to register, so I'll focus the 4-star radio and press Space to ensure the 4-star selection is set.
