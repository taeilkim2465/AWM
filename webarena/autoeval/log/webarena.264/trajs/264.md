## Intent

I want to browse the products in the Cabinets, Racks & Shelves category

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves" and the final page shows "Search results for: 'Cabinets, Racks & Shelves'" with items 1-12 of 5526 and product thumbnails visible, so the user can browse the products in that category. The navigation achieved the user's intent.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer category navigation) — I will use this. The site exposes a category menu, so navigating via the category menu is the most reliable way to reach "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves".
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (prefer category navigation) because the site exposes a category menu and that is the most reliable way to reach the Cabinets, Racks & Shelves group. I will not use Memory 2 (search box) because the user specifically asked to browse the category and the navigation menu is already open. I will use Memory 3 (validate search results / use category filters) later after I reach the category to confirm I'm in the correct subcategory.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer category navigation): I will use this — the page exposes a category list and the "Racks, Shelves & Drawers (117 item)" link is exactly the category closest to "Cabinets, Racks & Shelves".
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer category navigation): I will use this. The page already shows "Now Shopping by Category: Racks, Shelves & Drawers", so using the site category navigation is the right approach to browse this group.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows before taking the next action:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer category navigation for precise browsing): I will use this. The page shows a "Category" list in the left sidebar and Cabinets, Racks & Shelves is likely under "Storage & Organization", so using the category link should take us to the right product group reliably.
===============INFO - I'll use the site's category navigation (memory 1) because the page exposes a clear category list on the left, which is the most reliable way to reach Cabinets / Racks & Shelves. I will not use memory 2 (search box) because the user specifically asked to browse the category and the category links are already visible. I will keep memory 3 (validate search results) in mind to verify that the next page shows items from the selected subcategory.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer category navigation): I would normally use the site's category links to reach the exact category, but earlier attempts to click menu items timed out. Because of that risk, I will not rely on clicking the category navigation now.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer category navigation for precise browsing): I will use this — the page shows a "Category" list in the sidebar, which is the reliable way to reach the Cabinets/Racks & Shelves product group or a closely related category (Home & Kitchen). This follows the memory guidance to prefer category links over repeating searches.
