## Intent

Show me the "chairs" listings by ascending price.

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows "Search results for: 'chairs'" and the Sort By control is set to "Price" with an upward arrow next to it, indicating the listings are ordered by ascending price. The agent performed the search and selected Price sort (and toggled the order), so the requested view was achieved.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (product-level pricing) is not needed for this step — I'm just locating "chairs" and sorting, not verifying order details.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (verify product-level metadata and compute/sort discounted prices) — I will not use this now; it's about extracting and computing discounted prices on order pages, not needed for setting the listing sort.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3 because they are directly relevant: Memory 2 recommends using category navigation and explicit sorting/price bounds, and Memory 3 reminds to set ascending order when looking for low-to-high prices. I will not use Memory 1 because extracting product-level metadata and computing discounts is not needed for this step (the user only asked to show listings sorted by ascending price).
