## Intent

How much I spend in March 2023 on shopping at One Stop Market?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent located two orders in March 2023 on the One Stop Market orders page (3/11/23 $65.32 and 3/10/23 $17.99) and correctly summed them to $83.31. The screenshot of the My Orders page shows those two March entries and no additional March orders, so the information returned matches the page. The follow-up question about CSV/canceled orders is an appropriate optional prompt. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I found two orders in March 2023 on your One Stop Market account: $65.32 (3/11/23

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3: they advise looking for date-range selectors, summary totals, or export/report options to get March 2023 totals without opening every order. I'll try to go to the account page to find order history, summaries, or filters first.
===============INFO - I'll use the account page's order history summary instead of opening individual orders one-by-one if possible.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (date-range/summary): I will use this memory. It suggests looking for date-range or summary totals first to avoid opening each order individually. I don't see a date-range control or summary on the page, but there is a "Show per page" control that can help by showing more orders at once so I can find all March 2023 orders on one page.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check for date-range selectors and summary totals..." — I considered this and looked for filters or a monthly summary on the page, but there are no date-range controls or summary totals visible in the My Orders view. So I did not use a date-range control (none available).
