## Intent

Modify the address of order #299 to 456 Oak Avenue, Apartment 5B, New York, NY, 10001

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent opened the order, filled street (456 Oak Avenue), apartment (Apartment 5B), selected New York, filled city and ZIP, then clicked save. The page snapshot displays a yellow confirmation banner saying "You updated the order address," which directly indicates the address change succeeded for order #000000299. Therefore the modification task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use? Yes. It reminds me to confirm we're in the order address edit interface before changing fields — we are already on the "Order Address Information" edit page, so I will proceed to edit the visible fields.
