## Intent

Delete all pending reviews with less than 4 stars

## RM

Thoughts: The agent set the Status filter to "Pending" (action 5), performed delete actions and the page shows a success message "The review has been deleted." The grid with Status=Pending now displays "0 records found" and "We couldn't find any records." Because there are no pending reviews remaining on the page, any pending reviews with less than 4 stars have been removed (even though a star-rating filter isn't shown in the history). Therefore the requested deletion goal is satisfied.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide how I handle the pending reviews list:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use scrolling/pagination): I will use this—ensure we handle lazy-loading or multiple pages if there are more reviews. Right now the grid shows "1 records found", but I'll verify while working.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use scrolling and pagination clicks to load and verify all entries — I will use this later when processing the reviews grid so no reviews are missed (use: yes).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use scrolling and pagination clicks to load and verify all entries) — I will use this memory later when iterating through the full list of reviews to ensure I load all pending reviews (pagination/lazy-load). For the current step I only need to act on the open review, but I will rely on Memory 1 in subsequent steps.
