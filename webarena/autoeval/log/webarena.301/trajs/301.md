Thoughts: The My Orders page in the snapshot shows Order #000000189 dated 5/2/23 with Order Total $754.99 and Status "Pending". The agent's message correctly identified that order as the most recent pending (processing) order and offered to open the order details. This matches the user's intent and the page state, so the execution succeeded.
Status: "success"

I will NOT use Memory 3 because it focuses on cancelled orders, which are not relevant.
