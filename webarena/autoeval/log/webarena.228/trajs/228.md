## Intent

What is the price range for products from sephora?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent performed a search for "Sephora", inspected the current search-results page (8 items) and returned a clear price range ($10.99–$94.99) along with an itemized list of the visible prices and a note that the range reflects only the current page plus options to extend or refine the search. The final page snapshot shows the search results header and 8 items, matching the agent's claim. The response provides the requested information and appropriately qualifies its scope, so the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use the site's search box) because this site has an internal search control which is the fastest way to find brand products. I will also use Memory 2 (state the scope) so when I report a price range I'll clarify whether it comes from the visible search results or the entire site. I will not fully apply Memory 3 yet (itemized breakdown) because first I need search results to see available products and prices; I can produce an itemized list after the search if you want.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — the results were found using the site's search box, which is the fastest way to surface brand products, so I'll rely on the visible search results.
