{"id": 133, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent assumed 3/2 = March 2 and replied \"Eric Bailey made 2 commits on 03/02/2023\" without evidence. The page snapshot clearly shows \"02 Mar, 2023 3 commits\" (total) but does not show Eric's per-commit authors in the visible region, so the agent's specific claim (2 commits by Eric) is unsupported and likely incorrect. Because the required information (how many of those commits were by Eric) was not obtained or shown, this is a failure.", "status": "failure"}}
