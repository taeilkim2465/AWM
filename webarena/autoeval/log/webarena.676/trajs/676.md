## Intent

Lookup orders that are suspected of being fraudulent

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the "Suspected Fraud" status filter and searched for order 000000300 (active filters show Keyword: 000000300 and Status: Suspected Fraud). The orders list displays "0 records found" / "We couldn't find any records," so the agent correctly performed the lookup and clearly reported that no suspected-fraud orders match that keyword.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it directly recommends the correct approach for finding the earliest suspected order: apply the suspected-orders filter and sort by order date ascending. Memory 2 (checking for newer cancelled orders) is potentially useful later when verifying which order is the "most recent" relative to cancellations, but it's not needed right now. Memory 3 (postal code verification) is not relevant to this task.
===============INFO - I will navigate to the Orders list so I can filter for suspected/fraudulent orders and then inspect them.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it directly advises the correct approach: apply a status/filter for suspected orders and then sort by purchase date (oldest first) to locate the earliest suspect order. I will keep Memory 2 in mind (useful later) to check for any newer cancelled orders relative to the most recent active order when reporting results. Memory 3 (postal code verification) is not relevant for this task.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It directly applies — first filter to suspected orders, then sort by purchase date ascending to find the earliest suspected order.
