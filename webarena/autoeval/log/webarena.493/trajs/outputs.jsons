The action log shows the agent filled the customer name and the message field (IDs 840 and 1021) and clicked multiple buttons, but the final page snapshot shows the \"Notes for this Order\" / \"Comments History\" area is empty and there is no visible confirmation or sent email. That indicates the comment/notification was not recorded or sent. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.", "status": "failure"}}
