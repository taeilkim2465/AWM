## Intent

List all opened issues that report bugs

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for all open issues reporting bugs. The page shows a filter label:~"type: bug" with "Open 21" (21 results), and the visible list includes many bug issues (e.g., #316) — but the agent's message only returned two issue entries (and one, #33, isn't visible in the current snapshot). Because the agent did not list all open bug issues (and included an item not shown), it failed to provide the complete requested information.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Open issues labeled type: bug: - #316 — Clarify usage of flash alert — by Lukas Oppermann — labels: area: documentation, effort: low, type: bug; - #33 — Path alias doesn't work — by Administrator — labels: type: bug. Would you like me to open one of these issues or copy their URLs?"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the repository's Issues list as the canonical place for label-based views" — I will use this memory because the task asks for open issues that report bugs and the repository Issues list is the correct view to filter by label and status.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they all recommend using the repository's Issues list and its built-in label filters — I'm already on the Issues list (Open tab) so using that guidance is appropriate.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — we're on the repository Issues list, so it's the right place.
