## Intent

Abishek wants to check my dotfile configurations. Please invite him to the repo as a guest.

## RM

Thoughts: The Members page shows "Abishek S" listed as a Direct member with Max role set to "Guest" and "just now by Byte Blaze", indicating the user was successfully invited as a guest to the repo. The action history (searching for Abishek and clicking invite) matches this result.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check current members before opening the invite flow" — I will use this. I should open the repository and check its member list first to avoid duplicate invites.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Check current members before opening the invite flow) because we should confirm Abishek isn't already a member to avoid duplicate invites. I will also use Memory 3 (Verify selection and confirm the invite succeeded) as a guideline for the invite flow steps after locating the members list. Memory 2 (Confirm creation details) is not relevant here.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I should check the repository members first to avoid re-inviting Abishek if he's already a member. So I'll open the Members page.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to avoid re-inviting someone who is already a member — I can see the members table currently only lists "Byte Blaze", so Abishek is not present and we should proceed to invite him.
===============INFO - Memory check:
