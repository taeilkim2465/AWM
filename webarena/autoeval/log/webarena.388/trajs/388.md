===============INFO - Memory 1 is directly relevant (it instructs how to extract reviewer–rating pairs and handle pagination) — I will use it to guide how I find reviewers who left 1 or 2 star reviews and to remember to page through results if needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Systematic extraction of reviewer–rating pairs and pagination handling): I will use this — it's directly relevant for finding who gave 1 or 2 stars and instructs me to extract reviewer names and numeric ratings and follow pagination.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it directly applies: I need to extract reviewer names and numeric ratings from the review elements and check for pagination or "load more" to capture all reviews. Memory 2 and Memory 3 are not relevant to this task (they concern repositories and contribution roles), so I will not use them.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it instructs to extract reviewer names and ratings and to follow pagination until done — that's directly relevant. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because they relate to repositories and contribution roles, which are not relevant to extracting reviewers and star ratings for this product.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it tells me to extract reviewer names and numerical ratings and to follow pagination — that's directly relevant. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because they relate to repositories and contribution roles, which are irrelevant here.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it instructs to extract reviewer names and numeric ratings and to follow pagination — that's exactly what's needed to find who gave 1- or 2-star reviews. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because they relate to GitHub repository contributions, not product reviews on this site.
===============INFO - Memory 1 is directly relevant — I will use it: it reminds me to extract reviewer names and numeric ratings from each review and to follow pagination until all reviews are checked.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to extract reviewer names with their numeric ratings and to follow pagination until done — this page has a "Page 2" link so I should open it to find any 1- or 2-star reviews beyond page 1. Memory 2 and Memory 3 are about repository contributions and roles, which are not relevant to this product-reviews task, so I will not use them.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It tells me to extract reviewer–rating pairs and to follow pagination — that's directly relevant.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it instructs to extract reviewer–rating pairs and to follow pagination — that's directly relevant to finding who gave 1 or 2 stars. I will not use Memory 2 (irrelevant — about repositories) or Memory 3 (about repository roles and stars) because they don't apply to product reviews.
