## Intent

Find the page of the place where Mr. Rogers was filmed on the map.

## RM

Thoughts: The search for "WQED Pittsburgh" returned the correct result "Studio WQED, 4802 Fifth Avenue..." (the known filming location), and the map highlights the WQED building. However the interface is still showing search results rather than the place's detail page — the specific result link was not opened. The user asked to find the place page, so stopping at the search results is incomplete.
Status: "failure"
