{"id": 749, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The snapshot shows the project \"project_site\" exists and the Invite members modal contains Primer, Convex Eggtart, and Vinta Chen in the username field, but the Invite button appears disabled/processing and there is no confirmation that invitations were submitted or that members were added. Additionally there is no visible confirmation that the NodeJS template was selected when creating the project or that the project visibility is explicitly set to private. Because the required creation details (NodeJS template and private visibility) and a clear successful member-invite confirmation are not evidenced, the task cannot be considered completed.", "status": "failure"}}
