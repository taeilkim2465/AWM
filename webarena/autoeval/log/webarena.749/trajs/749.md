## Intent

Start a private project project_site with NodeJS template and add primer, convexegg, vinta as members

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot shows the project "project_site" exists and the Invite members modal contains Primer, Convex Eggtart, and Vinta Chen in the username field, but the Invite button appears disabled/processing and there is no confirmation that invitations were submitted or that members were added. Additionally there is no visible confirmation that the NodeJS template was selected when creating the project or that the project visibility is explicitly set to private. Because the required creation details (NodeJS template and private visibility) and a clear successful member-invite confirmation are not evidenced, the task cannot be considered completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Ensure the chosen template is applied and the repo is truly blank" — I will use this memory later when the template selection appears and after project creation to verify the NodeJS template was applied and the repo contents are blank. So: use = yes.
===============INFO - Memory review and whether to use them now:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Ensure the chosen template is applied and the repo is truly blank" — I will use this later after creating the project to confirm the template selection and repository contents, so I will not use it right now but will follow it after project creation.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Ensure the chosen template is applied and the repo is truly blank" — I will use this memory to verify the NodeJS/Node Express template was applied. The page already shows "Initialized from 'NodeJS Express' project template" and project files (app.js, package.json, etc.), so the template was applied and the repo is not blank. I'll note that and proceed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ensure template applied & repo blank): I will use this later to confirm the NodeJS template was applied and that the repo contents match the "blank" expectation. For now, adding members is the next step, but after inviting I should verify the template via the Repository if needed.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - I'll consider the stored memories before acting.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Ensure the chosen template is applied and the repo is truly blank" — I will not use this right now because we're already on the project's Members page and the immediate task is to invite members. (If needed after inviting, we could verify the repo contents separately.)
