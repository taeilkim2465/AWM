## Intent

Change my reddit bio to "Seeking SDE positions"

## RM

Thoughts: The biography textbox contains "Seeking SDE positions", the Preview and the profile sidebar show the same text, and there is a green confirmation message "The biography was updated." indicating the change was saved. These observations confirm the bio was successfully changed to the requested text.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Save changes and verify the update): I will use this memory because after editing the bio I need to save and confirm the change is applied. I won't perform the save step yet — first I need to open the profile/settings UI.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (Locate and edit the bio/about text field) because it directly reminds me that I need to open the profile edit area and edit the bio. I will also keep Memory 1 (Save changes and verify the update) in mind for the next step after editing so I remember to save and confirm the new bio. Memory 2 (Open the dedicated list page...) is not relevant for editing the biography.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 3 but not Memory 2.
