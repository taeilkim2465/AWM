For an information-seeking task the agent needed to present the nearby restaurants (or say they are unavailable); merely displaying them on the map without returning that information in the response is insufficient. Therefore the task is not completed successfully.", "status": "failure"}}

The agent searched twice and the final page shows the OpenStreetMap search panel with \"No results found.\" The agent did not return a list of nearby restaurants nor explicitly report that no restaurant information is available; the map itself does show nearby food icons (e.g., Patron Pronto, Union Grill, Orient Express) but the agent did not extract or present them. Because the requested information was not provided to the user, the task failed.", "status": "failure"}}
