## Intent

Draft an email to the shop owner via their contact us function for a coupon as I am a student

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened the Contact Us page and filled the form with the user's name, email, and message, but there is no action to submit/send the form (no click on a submit button). The final page snapshot shows the form still present and filled rather than a confirmation or sent state. Therefore the message was not actually sent.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it suggests composing a concise, polite coupon/loyalty request including sender name and contact details; I'll use this to draft the message after I open the contact form.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compose a concise, polite coupon/loyalty request with contact details): I will use this — it directly guides how to write the message (short, polite, include name/email, ask for a student coupon).
