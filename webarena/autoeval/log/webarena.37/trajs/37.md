## Intent

Check if the police station in pittsburgh can be reached in one hour by car from gates building at CMU

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the origin and destination and selected Car (OSRM) but the final map snapshot only shows a marker and a broad regional map — there is no route drawn, no directions panel, and no travel time shown. Because the page does not display a computed driving duration (or an explicit statement that the info isn't available), the agent did not provide the required answer to whether the police station is reachable within one hour. Therefore the task failed.
Status: "failure"
