## Intent

Fill the "contact us" form in the site for a refund on the bluetooth speaker I bought, stating that it broke after just three days of use. Also, ensure to include the order number #161 and the product SKU. Don't submit yet, I will check.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (concise defect, timeframe, refund amount, offer photos/return instructions): I will use this — it's directly relevant for composing the message text describing the defect (broke after 3 days) and offering evidence/asking about return steps.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to be concise about the defect and timeline, offer evidence, and ask about return instructions. I will use those guidelines but cannot include a specific refund amount because the user did not provide one.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it's directly relevant. It suggests how to phrase the message concisely (defect, timeframe, refund request, offer photos, ask about return). I'll keep that guidance when I update the message if needed.
===============INFO - Memory usage:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it directly matches the user's request to be concise about the defect, include the timeframe, offer photos, and ask about return instructions — that should go in the message body. I will not use Memory 2 (cancellation confirmation) because this is a refund request rather than a cancellation confirmation. I will not use Memory 3 (product page layout) because it's unrelated.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (be concise about defect, timeframe, refund requested) — I will use this memory because it matches the user's request to state the defect (broke after three days), request a refund, offer photos, and ask about return instructions. Memory 2 (cancellation confirmation) — not relevant here because we are requesting a refund for a product, not canceling an order. Memory 3 (verify capacity on product pages) — not relevant.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I'll use the memories to decide what to include in the message:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It advises being concise about the defect, timeframe, refund requested, and offering photos/return instructions — I'll include that in the message.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Be concise about defect, timeframe, and the refund requested): I will use this — it matches the message content and reminds me to offer photos and ask about returns.
