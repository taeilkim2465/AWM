===============INFO - I will consider the provided memory items before taking any action:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use category labels/merchant keywords): I will not use this right now. The user asked for total spend on a specific date at this store (One Stop Market), not to isolate food-related spending, so category filtering isn't needed for this step.
