## Intent

Get the order number of my most recent on hold order 

## RM

Thoughts: The orders table in the snapshot shows 000000170 (5/17/23) as Canceled and the next row 000000189 (5/2/23) as Pending. The agent reported 000000189 as the most recent on-hold (Pending) order and correctly noted 000000170 is newer but canceled, so excluded. This matches the page content, so the information-seeking task was completed correctly.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "The most recent on-hold (Pending

===============INFO - I will use the provided memories to guide the steps:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Locate the latest processing order) — I will use this. It tells me to open the orders list and look for orders with a processing-like status (e.g., pending/on-hold) and pick the most recent; that's directly relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It instructs to open the orders table and filter by processing/pending — that's exactly what we need to find "on hold" orders.
