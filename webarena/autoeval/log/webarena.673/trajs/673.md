## Intent

Gather the titles of Racing Wheel Overdrive for Xbox X reviews with 1 star rating from OneStopShop, and post them in the games subreddit under the title "real user feedback on Racing Wheel Overdrive for Xbox X"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the product reviews on OneStopShop and the snapshot shows at least one 1-star review titled "Only works with certain games." However the action history shows only site navigation/clicks on the store page and no actions to collect all 1-star review titles or to post anything to the games subreddit. Because the posting step (and complete collection of all 1-star titles) was not performed, the overall task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use site review filters and confirm extraction targets — I will use this. It’s directly relevant: once I find the product page I should look for any built-in rating filters or isolate reviews with 1-star ratings and extract the review title text (not metadata).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use site review filters and confirm extraction targets — I will use this memory (yes). We need to filter for 1-star reviews or otherwise identify review ratings and extract titles; I'll look for review filters or the reviews section once on the product page.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (site review filters & confirm extraction targets): I will use this — it's directly relevant. First I need to open the Reviews section, look for any built-in rating filters (or the individual review ratings) and then collect review titles for those with 1-star. I'll confirm the elements I extract are the review title text.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (site review filters / extraction targets) because it reminds me to use page navigation and confirm I'm extracting review title text (not metadata). I will not use Memory 2 (repo filtering) because it's irrelevant. I will note Memory 3 (compose community posts) for later when I prepare the Reddit post content, but I won't use it right now because first I need to collect all 1-star review titles from the product reviews.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it's directly relevant. I'll apply the site's filters/pagination approach: identify reviews with the 1-star indicator (20% in these review blocks) and check page 2 as well.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use site review filters and confirm extraction targets): I will use this memory. It reminds me to use the site's review navigation/filters and confirm I'm extracting review titles (not metadata). Right now the page shows reviews and pagination; I should navigate pages to find all 1-star reviews.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it reminds me to filter or paginate through the site's reviews to capture the correct rating (1-star corresponds to the 20% shown on this site) and to validate I'm extracting review titles (the summary text at the top of each review). I'll use Memory 3 to help later when composing the Reddit post (clear title and useful body). I will not use Memory 2 because it's unrelated.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use site review filters and confirm extraction targets): I will use this — it reminds me to use the site's pagination/filters and confirm I'm extracting the review titles (not metadata). I should load page 1 to capture any additional 1-star review titles.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide my next step:
