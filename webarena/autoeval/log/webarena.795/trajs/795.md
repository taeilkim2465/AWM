## Intent

Change the delivery address for my most recent order to 6726 McPherson Blvd, Pittsburgh, PA.

## RM

Thoughts: The action history and final snapshot show the agent landed on the Address Book page. The Default Shipping Address remains the original address (222 Redwood Rise, Suite 300, Seattle, Washington, 98101) and there are no additional address entries or any indication the most recent order's delivery address was updated to 6726 McPherson Blvd, Pittsburgh, PA. A "Change Shipping Address" link is present but no change was made. Therefore the user's requested change was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will verify whether the order is editable and where the "change/edit delivery address" control appears once I open the order. This guides whether I can change the address directly or need a fallback (contact support/cancel).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to safely update the address:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (confirm editability & UI path) — I will use this. It reminds me to check whether the order is editable and to look for a "change/edit delivery address" control. Right now the order status is "Pending", which might allow changes, but I don't see an address-edit control on this order page. So I should try the address-management path (Address Book) as the next step.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide the next steps.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm editability and UI path): I will use this — before changing the address I need to confirm the order is editable and find the "change/edit delivery address" control on the order details page.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm editability and UI path) — USE: I should first check whether the most recent order is editable and locate the "Change/Edit delivery address" control on the order details page. If the order status disallows edits, I will prepare a fallback.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2, and skip Memory 3.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It reminds me to verify the order is editable and to look for the specific "change/edit delivery address" control on the order details page before attempting to change the address.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It reminds me to check whether the order is editable and to look for a "change/edit delivery address" control before trying to change the address. I'll try to follow that path (locate an edit control) or fall back to updating the Address Book if the order details page lacks an edit option.
