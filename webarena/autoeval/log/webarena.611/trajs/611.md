## Intent

Post a review of my recent reading "Harry Potter" in the r/books with my comment "Wonderful journey".

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the title and body and attempted to submit (click action), but the page displays a red error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." and the agent notified the user it could not submit. The submission was not completed and the post was not published, so the task (posting the review) failed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I filled the submission for r/books (Title: "Review: Harry Potter", Body: "Wonderful journey"

===============INFO - We have the submission page open with Title "Review: Harry Potter" and Body "Wonderful journey", and the Forum set to "books". The page shows a red notice: "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." That indicates a rate-limit or posting restriction preventing submission right now.
