## Intent

Tell me the count of comments that have received more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the photoshopbattles forum.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the user's profile/comments (OCDGaming), inspected the Comments tab and the two visible comments which show net scores of 13 and 14 (both positive). The agent responded with the count "0" (no comments with more downvotes than upvotes). The requested information (count) was provided and matches the page snapshot, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "0 — I checked OCDGaming's comments on this page; the two visible comments have net scores 13 and 14 (both positive

===============INFO - I'll use the memory items about interpreting condensed vote displays as net scores (Memory 1, Memory 2, Memory 3). They are relevant because the forum UI often shows a single vote number per comment; a negative net score indicates more downvotes than upvotes, which is exactly what we need to count. So: use Memory 1 (yes), Memory 2 (yes), Memory 3 (yes).
===============INFO - Memory 1, 2, and 3 are all relevant and I'll use them:
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items about interpreting condensed vote displays as net scores because the comment listings on this site show a single number between the up/down vote controls (so a negative number means more downvotes than upvotes).
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they explain how to interpret condensed vote displays (single net score) and how to detect comments with more downvotes than upvotes by checking for negative net scores. This is directly relevant since I'll need to count the user's comments that show a negative vote number.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Interpret condensed vote displays as net scores): I will use this — it lets me infer more-downvoted comments from negative net scores when the UI only shows a single vote number.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items about interpreting condensed vote displays as net scores (Memory 1, Memory 2, Memory 3). They are relevant because reddit-style pages often show a single vote number per comment representing upvotes minus downvotes; a negative number therefore indicates more downvotes than upvotes. I'll rely on those rules when counting comments with more downvotes than upvotes.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because the page's comment listings show a single vote number between the up/down controls, so treating that number as the net score (upvotes minus downvotes) lets me identify comments with more downvotes than upvotes by checking for negative values.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories about interpreting condensed vote displays as net scores:
