## Intent

Post my question, "safe and budge apartment to live in nyc", in a subreddit where I'm likely to get an answer

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the title and body, selected the 'nyc' forum, and tried to submit, but the site returned "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The agent informed the user and offered valid next steps. However the post was not actually submitted and the final page still shows the error and the filled form, so the user's request to post the question was not completed.

Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I filled your title and body and selected the 'nyc' forum, but the site shows: “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.” I cannot submit the post right now. Options:\n\n- Wait and try again later (I can retry when you tell me

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 (fill both the title and body with a clear, specific question) because the user asked me to post their question and that increases visibility. I will not use Memory 1 (Answer straightforward factual queries immediately) since this is an action task, not a direct factual Q&A. I will not use Memory 2 (open canonical post to get reliable author link) because that's about inspecting other posts' author links and isn't necessary for creating a new submission.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 because it recommended filling both title and body (already done). I won't use Memory 1 (not a factual query) or Memory 2 (not needed for posting). Next I should select an appropriate subreddit — "nyc" is available and a good fit — then submit the post.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Answer straightforward factual queries immediately): Not useful here — the user wants me to post their question, not a simple factual answer. I will not use this memory.
