## Intent

Create a product view report from 07/05/2021 to 05/31/2023

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the Product Views Report, filled the From and To fields with 07/05/2021 and 05/31/2023 and clicked the Show Report button. However the final page snapshot shows only the filter area (dates) and no generated report results or table of product views, so the report was not produced/visible after the actions. Therefore the task did not complete successfully.
Status: "failure"
