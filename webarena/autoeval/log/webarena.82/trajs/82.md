## Intent

What is the duration required to first walk from Massachusetts Institute of Technology to Harvard University, and then drive to Boston Logan International Airport?

## RM

Thoughts: The final page snapshot shows directions only for walking from Massachusetts Institute of Technology to Harvard University (Distance 3.3 km, Time 0:45). Although the action history includes attempts to request a car route from Harvard to Boston Logan, the current UI displays the Foot (OSRM) route only and no driving duration or combined total is shown. Because the agent did not provide the driving leg (Harvard → Logan) or the summed duration, the user's request was not satisfied.  
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (enumerate candidate airports): I will NOT use this — the user specified Boston Logan International Airport explicitly, so I don't need to search for candidate airports.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 (use pedestrian routing profile) because the user asked for walking time for the first leg. I'll also use Memory 3 (use recognizable institution names) to enter "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" and "Harvard University" so the directions tool can resolve them. I will not use Memory 1 (enumerate candidate airports) because the user specified Boston Logan International Airport explicitly and we only need a direct drive from Harvard to Logan for the second leg.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1? No — the user asked specifically about driving to Boston Logan International Airport, so enumerating airports is unnecessary.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (use a pedestrian routing profile for walking) because the user asked for walking time from MIT to Harvard and the walking profile gives realistic estimates. I will also use Memory 3 (prefer recognizable institution names) to ensure the directions tool finds MIT and Harvard correctly. I will not use Memory 1 (airport enumeration) because we only need Logan Airport and the driving route to it, not a list of airports.
===============INFO - I will get the driving duration from Harvard University to Boston Logan International Airport so I can report both the walk time (MIT → Harvard) and the drive time (Harvard → Logan).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (enumerate airports) is not needed — I already have the specific airport (Logan) and only need the two-leg durations.
===============INFO - I'll decide about the memory items first:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (use pedestrian routing profile) because the user asked for walking time for the first leg — that gives more accurate walking durations. I will use Memory 3 (use institution names) to fill origin/destination with "Massachusetts Institute of Technology" and "Harvard University" so the directions tool resolves the correct campuses. I will not use Memory 1 (airport enumeration) because we already know the destination is Boston Logan International Airport and don't need to search candidate airports.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (yes) because it reminded me to use the pedestrian profile for the walking leg — the page already shows the walking route (Foot/OSRM) and time. I will use Memory 3 (yes) to prefer recognizable venue names (Harvard University, Boston Logan International Airport) when filling the directions fields. I will not use Memory 1 (no) because I don't need to enumerate nearby airports; the user asked specifically about driving from Harvard to Logan.
===============INFO - We need two durations: walking time MIT -> Harvard, and driving time Harvard -> Logan. I'll use the memory items as follows:
