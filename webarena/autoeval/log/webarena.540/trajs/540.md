## Intent

Modify the address of order #301 to 321 Birch Boulevard, Suite 200, Dallas, TX, 75201

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the street, suite, state, city, and zip were cleared/filled and a save/click was performed. The page displays a confirmation banner "You updated the order address." and the order number matches #000000301. These indicate the address modification completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 to remind me to open the order's edit/address edit interface before making changes — that is relevant and important. I will also use Memory 2 when I report back the updated address and order metadata to the user so they get clear context. I will not use Memory 3 because it warns against unrelated heuristics; it's not needed here.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Enter edit mode before making changes): I will use this — it's important to open the order record's edit/address form before modifying the address so the changes apply correctly.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to ensure I enter the address edit interface before making changes (so edits apply correctly). I'll also use Memory 2 so after updating I'll report the updated billing address together with key order metadata. I will not apply Memory 3 because its warning about other heuristics doesn't apply to this straightforward address-edit task.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Enter edit mode before making changes): I will use this. The page already shows the Order Address Information form and editable fields, so we are in edit mode and can proceed to modify the address fields.
