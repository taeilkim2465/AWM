## Intent

Get directions from Carnegie Music Hall in NYC to Carnegie Mellon University using driving options.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for driving directions from "Carnegie Music Hall" (NYC) to Carnegie Mellon. The agent filled the origin as "Carnegie Hall, New York, NY" and produced a driving route, but did not confirm that "Carnegie Hall" equals the requested "Carnegie Music Hall" before returning directions. Because the origin may be incorrect and the agent only offered a clarification after presenting the route, it did not unambiguously fulfill the user's specified request.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I used the site’s directions tool and found a driving route. Summary:\n- Origin shown: Carnegie Hall (7th Avenue, New York, NY

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (use the site's directions/distance tool) because OpenStreetMap's "Find directions between two points" is exactly the built-in feature needed. I'll also use Memory 3 (compute driving time by filling origin and destination into a directions tool) to guide filling the origin and destination and selecting driving options. I will not explicitly use Memory 2 (map search to retrieve addresses) because I already have the place names the user provided (Carnegie Music Hall, NYC and Carnegie Mellon University) and the directions tool can search for them directly.
===============INFO - I will use the site's built-in directions feature to get driving time and route (Memory 1 and Memory 3). Memory 1: USE — it suggests using the site's directions/distance tool, which is exactly available on this page. Memory 3: USE — it reinforces filling origin/destination to obtain driving-time estimates. Memory 2: DO NOT USE — we don't need to separately look up addresses or ZIP codes first because the map's directions input can resolve place names via autocomplete.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the site's directions/distance tool to get driving time — I will use this (yes). The page already shows directions generated by the site's routing tool.
