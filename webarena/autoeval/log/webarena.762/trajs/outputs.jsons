The action history shows the agent filled both endpoints and selected \"Car (OSRM)\" and clicked Go multiple times, but the final page snapshot only displays the input fields and a marker near Pittsburgh \u2014 no route is drawn and no directions, distance, or travel time are shown. For an information-seeking directions task the agent must return the route or explicitly state it's unavailable; neither is present here. Therefore the task failed.", "status": "failure"}}
{"id": 762, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for driving directions from \"Carnegie Music Hall\" (NYC) to Carnegie Mellon. The agent filled the origin as \"Carnegie Hall, New York, NY\" and produced a driving route, but did not confirm that \"Carnegie Hall\" equals the requested \"Carnegie Music Hall\" before returning directions. Because the origin may be incorrect and the agent only offered a clarification after presenting the route, it did not unambiguously fulfill the user's specified request.", "status": "failure"}}
