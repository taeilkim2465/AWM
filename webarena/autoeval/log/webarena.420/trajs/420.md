## Intent

Set my gitlab status as Playing Badminton.

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the status field was cleared and filled with "Playing Badminton.", saved, and the user menu was opened. The final page snapshot confirms the profile dropdown displays "Playing Badminton." under the username, so the status was successfully set. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Done — your GitLab status is set to "Playing Badminton." I can change or clear it if you want. What would you like next?'
