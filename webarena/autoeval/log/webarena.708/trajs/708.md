===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it instructs to set an explicit From/To date to the full calendar year and choose matching aggregation (Yearly). I'll apply this when I open the tax report.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items to guide generating an annual tax report:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they directly apply to generating an annual report:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Set an explicit year date range and matching aggregation" — I will NOT use this memory because it recommends setting the full calendar year and Year aggregation. The user asked for a tax report "for this year" on 3/15/2023, which implies a year-to-date report (Jan 1, 2023 through 3/15/2023), not the full calendar year. Using Memory 1 would set an end date of 12/31/23, which is not correct for the user's current-date request.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Set an explicit year date range and matching aggregation): I will not use this memory. It advises setting From/To to the full calendar year and choosing Yearly aggregation for an annual report. The user asked for a tax report "for this year" on 3/15/2023 — that's best interpreted as year-to-date (Jan 1, 2023 through today), not the full calendar year ending Dec 31, so full-year aggregation is not appropriate.
===============INFO - I will consider the memory items before acting.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It says to set the From/To dates to the full calendar year and choose Yearly aggregation. That matches the user's request to "generate a tax report for this year" (2023).
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to ensure the report is correctly configured before generating it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Set an explicit year date range and matching aggregation" — I will NOT use this. It's for generating a full-calendar-year annual report (Jan–Dec), but the user asked for a tax report "for this year" as of today (3/15/2023), so we need a year-to-date range instead of a full calendar year.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it instructs to set the From/To to the full calendar year and choose matching aggregation. I will set From = 01/01/2023 and To = 12/31/2023 and keep Period = Year.
