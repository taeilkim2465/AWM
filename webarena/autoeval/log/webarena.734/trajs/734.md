## Intent

Edit my post on Ted Lasso by adding a line to the body that says "Done watching. I love the renew!"

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the post was opened for editing (clicks and fill), the body field was filled with "Done watching. I love the renew!" and the save/submit button was clicked. The final page displays that exact line in the post body and a green notification "The submission was edited." These confirm the requested edit was applied.
Status: "success"
