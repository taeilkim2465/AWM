## Intent

I am at CMU Pittsburgh, how long it takes to the nearest USPS postal office with different transportation methods?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for travel times from CMU to the nearest USPS by different transport modes. The agent only performed several place-search queries on Nominatim and clicked but the final page shows a global map with no search result or any routing/travel-time information. No durations or mode-specific travel estimates were provided or shown. Therefore the task did not deliver the requested information. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find nearest facilities): USE — I'll locate CMU precisely on the map and then search nearby for the nearest USPS/post office candidate(s).
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they guide finding the nearest facility by geocoding the origin and returning the closest post office with distance/time and next steps; these are directly relevant. I will not use Memory 3 yet because I first need to locate candidate post offices before verifying full postal addresses from authoritative sources.

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I should switch to a different, structured location search (Nominatim) and plan to geocode CMU and nearby post offices, then compute closest candidate(s).
