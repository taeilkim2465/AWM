## Intent

Make all Taurus Elements Shell as out of stock

## RM

Thoughts: The intent was to mark all "Taurus Elements Shell" items out of stock. The actions show a single select_option('1019','Out of Stock') among many clicks, but the final product page for "Taurus Elements Shell-XS-Blue" still shows Enable Product = Yes and Quantity = 100 (and the Save button is visible), so the product remains in stock. There's no evidence other variants were updated. Therefore the agent did not complete the task for all items (and likely didn't save the change for this one).
Status: "failure"
