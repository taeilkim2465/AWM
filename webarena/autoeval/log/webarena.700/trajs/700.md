## Intent

Draft a new marketing price rule for fall discount that offers $10 discount on checkout for all customers

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent created a rule name and description, set Active to Yes, selected the Main Website, selected customer groups (all groups), navigated to the Actions section, set "Apply" to "Fixed amount discount for whole cart" and entered discount amount "10", and clicked Save. The final page snapshot shows the new rule populated (name, description, active, website). All required pieces for a site-wide $10 checkout discount for all customers were provided and the rule was saved. Therefore the rule drafting completed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (Cart price rule creation checklist) because it contains the required fields and typical settings for creating a site-wide cart price rule — that will guide how I populate the new rule form after opening it. I'll keep Memory 2 (Verify save and test the rule) in mind for after creation to confirm the rule is saved and to test it, so I'll not actively use it right now but will follow it later. I will not use Memory 3 (order detail price verification) at this step because that's for validating discounted prices on an order page after the rule is created and tested.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Cart price rule creation checklist) because it reminds me which fields to set for a site-wide rule (rule name/description, active, websites, include all customer groups, no coupon/auto-apply, and Actions settings). I will not fully apply all items from Memory 1 right now (I will set name/description first, then set customer groups and action settings in the next steps) but I will follow its guidance overall.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Cart price rule creation checklist): Use — it's directly relevant (reminds to set rule name, active status, websites, customer groups, coupon, discount type/amount, dates, priority). I'll follow it.
===============INFO - I'll consider the stored memories before taking action.
===============INFO - Reviewing the memories:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Cart price rule creation checklist): I will use this. It lists the required fields and typical settings to verify (rule name/description, active status, websites/stores, customer groups, coupon setting, conditions, discount type/amount, date range, priority, usage limits). That matches what I should confirm for the Fall $10 Checkout Discount.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Cart price rule creation checklist): I will use this — it reminds me to ensure rule name, description, active status, websites, customer groups, coupon type, discount type and amount, and date range are set before saving. Relevant and helpful now.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Cart price rule creation checklist): I will use this to confirm the required fields (name, description, active status, websites, all customer groups, no coupon/auto-apply, discount type and amount). This is relevant.
