## Intent

Thumbs down the top 4 post ever in movies.

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted the top 4 all-time posts in /f/movies downvoted. The final page shows the highest-scoring posts (e.g. 3356, 3222) still with neutral/grey vote arrows, while only some low-scored items near the top show blue down arrows and -1 — indicating the top 4 highest-scoring posts were not thumbed down. The action history shows many clicks but the visible state does not reflect downvotes on the top 4 all-time posts, so the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"
