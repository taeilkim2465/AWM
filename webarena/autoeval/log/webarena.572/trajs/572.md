## Intent

I recently moved, my address is 654 Aspen Road, House #3, Boston, MA, 02110, update my information on OneStopShopping accordingly

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the address form was filled and saved (click '2112'). The page displays a green "You saved the address." confirmation and the Address Book lists both Default Billing and Default Shipping addresses as "654 Aspen Road, House #3, Boston, Massachusetts, 02110," matching the user's requested update. This indicates the update was applied successfully.
Status: "success"
