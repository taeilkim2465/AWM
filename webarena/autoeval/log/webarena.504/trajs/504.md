## Intent

Make all Selene yoga hoodie as out of stock

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filtered the product list for "Selene yoga hoodie" (16 records found) but the final page snapshot still shows Quantity and Salable Quantity as 100 (Default Stock: 100) for the listed SKUs and Status is Enabled — nothing indicates stock was changed to zero or "Out of Stock". The action history shows clicks and navigation but no evidence of successfully updating inventory to make items out of stock. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I should ensure all matching products are visible (check filters, pagination, "Load More") before changing stock.
===============INFO - We need to set all "Selene yoga hoodie" products to out of stock. To do this I should open the product list and locate every product/variant named "Selene yoga hoodie", check variant-level SKU and salable stock, and update inventory.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2, and not use Memory 3.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ensure complete visibility): I will use this — there are 16 records found and the per-page is set to 200, so all Selene yoga hoodie products appear on this page. I should still be mindful of pagination or "load more" but here per-page=200 and it shows "of 1", so all items are visible. I'll proceed using that knowledge.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ensure complete visibility of all items for the date): I will use this. The page already shows "16 records found" and per page is set to 200, so all Selene Yoga Hoodie records are visible on this page. That means a bulk action will affect all items currently listed.
===============INFO - Memory usage:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Ensure complete visibility of all items for the date): I will use this. It reminds me to check for pagination / load-more and overlays that can block clicks. Right now a fixed "page-actions" bar was intercepting clicks on the header checkbox, so I should try actions that avoid being blocked or ensure the table is fully visible.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2, and ignore Memory 3.
===============INFO - Memory check:
