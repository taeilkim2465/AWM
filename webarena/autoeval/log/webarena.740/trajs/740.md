## Intent

Show me the way from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of NYC NBA team 

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for a route from Carnegie Mellon University to a NYC NBA team's home stadium. The action history shows only the origin was entered and the agent asked a clarification (Madison Square Garden or Barclays Center); the destination was not filled and no route was generated on the map. Because the task requires navigating to/showing the route and that was not completed, the execution did not fulfill the user's intent.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (procedure for identifying the university with the most award winners) is not relevant to giving directions, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (procedure for identifying a university on a map): I will not use this — it's about aggregating award winners and isn't relevant to plotting a route from Carnegie Mellon to an arena.
