## Intent

DisLike all submissions created by RickyDontLoseThat in subreddit massachusetts

## RM

Thoughts: The agent performed repeated searches for "subreddit:massachusetts author:RickyDontLoseThat" and the final page clearly shows "No results" / "There are no entries to display." There are therefore no submissions to downvote in that subreddit by that author, so there was nothing to dislike. Although no downvote actions were taken, the agent correctly determined there were no applicable posts to modify.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created matching item): I will use this — it helps find the newest submissions from the target user so I can act on them first.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created matching item): I will keep this in mind for later — if the search returns multiple submissions I should act on the newest ones first. I will not apply it yet because I first need to get search results.
===============INFO - I will search for all posts by the user without restricting to the subreddit (the previous search returned no results for the subreddit filter). This may show posts across the site, and then I can look for those in the massachusetts community.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created matching item): I will use this — if results appear, I should act on the newest matching submissions first.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created matching item): I will use this — we need to find all submissions by RickyDontLoseThat and act on the newest ones first if needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created matching item): I can use this if we need to act on the newest posts by the user, but the user asked to "DisLike all submissions" (not only the newest). So I will not rely only on this memory right now, but I may use it later if we need to pick ordering. (Not used immediately, but kept in mind.)
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created matching item): I will use this if the search returns multiple submissions — I'll target the most recent ones first when disliking them.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created matching item): Useful. If I find multiple submissions by the user, I may need to process them in order — I'll use this strategy to ensure I can target the newest first if needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the most recently created matching item): I will use this — it’s useful to ensure we act on the newest submissions if multiple matches appear. Using the search will let us sort/find matches and then pick the latest.
