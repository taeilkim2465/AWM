## Intent

Get the product name and discounted price (low to high) of the most recent completed order

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for product names and discounted prices (sorted low-to-high) from the most recent completed order. The action history shows the agent filtered orders to "Complete" and opened order #000000230, but the final page snapshot only shows the Order & Account Information section (order metadata). There is no visible "Items Ordered" list, product names, or prices in the snapshot, and no action in the history indicates extracting item data or applying a price sort. Because the required product/price information (and the requested low-to-high ordering) is not present or returned, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the provided memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Aggregate recent orders by timestamp): I will use this — I need to identify the single most recent order by recency, so sorting by timestamp is required.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (filter by order status before locating the most recent) because we need the most recent order with status "Complete". I will also use Memory 2 (verify product-level metadata on detail pages) because after opening the order I should confirm the product name and discounted price on the order detail page rather than relying on summary data. I will not use Memory 1 (aggregate recent orders) because the user only asked for the most recent completed order, not an aggregate.

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 (filter by status) because the task asks for the most recent completed order — filtering to "Complete" first reduces noise and ensures we only consider completed orders. I'll also use Memory 1 (aggregate recent orders by timestamp) to ensure I pick the most recent order after filtering and sorting by purchase date. Memory 2 (verify product-level metadata on detail pages) is useful later when I open the order detail to confirm product names and discounted prices, so I'll keep it in mind but not fully apply it until I open the order detail.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Aggregate recent orders by timestamp): I will use this — it tells me to identify the most recent order by timestamp. I'll apply that when choosing which completed order to open.
