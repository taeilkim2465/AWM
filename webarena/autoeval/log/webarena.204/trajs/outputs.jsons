There is no visible \"Items Ordered\" list, product names, or prices in the snapshot, and no action in the history indicates extracting item data or applying a price sort. Because the required product/price information (and the requested low-to-high ordering) is not present or returned, the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
