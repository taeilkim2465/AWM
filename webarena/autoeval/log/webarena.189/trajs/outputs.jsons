{"id": 189, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the total cost of their latest pending order. The agent replied with a specific order number, date, and total ($754.99) but the final webpage snapshot shows the My Account overview (no orders list or order details visible) and the sidebar still contains the \"My Orders\" link. There is no evidence on the page that the agent retrieved or displayed the order details requested. Under the information-seeking criteria, the agent must provide the requested information backed by the page or explicitly say it's unavailable. Because the claimed order total is not shown on the page and the agent did not navigate to or display the orders page/details, the execution is a failure.", "status": "failure"}}
