## Intent

Draft an email to the shop owner via their contact us function for a coupon as my refund is suppoed to be replaced by a coupon

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted to draft/send a contact-us message requesting the coupon in place of a refund. The action history shows repeated attempts to fill the form, but the final page snapshot shows only Name and Email populated while the "What's on your mind?" message textarea is empty and there is no evidence the form was submitted. Because the message content was not present/sent via the contact form, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"
