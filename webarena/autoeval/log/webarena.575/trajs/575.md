## Intent

I recently moved, my address is 222 Redwood Rise, Suite 300, Seattle, WA, 98101, update my information on OneStopShopping accordingly

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the address fields were cleared and filled, and the final page displays a confirmation banner "You saved the address." Both Default Billing and Default Shipping addresses on the Address Book show "222 Redwood Rise, Suite 300, Seattle, Washington, 98101," which matches the user's requested update, so the update was applied successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the dedicated list page for "view my items"): Not relevant for this step — it's about viewing lists; I need account settings/address management.
===============INFO - I will use the page's Address Book controls to update the address.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the dedicated list page) — Not needed: this page is already the Address Book and shows the address entries, so I don't need to navigate to a different list page.
