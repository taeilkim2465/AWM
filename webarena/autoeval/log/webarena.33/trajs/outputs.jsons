{"id": 33, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent located a Hilton property (DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pittsburgh Airport) and clearly reported it. For the supermarket/distance request the agent explicitly stated that the OpenStreetMap search returned no supermarket results and therefore it could not determine a walking distance, and offered to expand the search (Google Maps/broader web). That satisfies the requirement to either provide the requested information or explicitly state it is not available on the page shown.", "status": "success"}}
{"id": 33, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The action history shows multiple searches for Hilton hotels and nearby supermarkets, but the final page snapshot is the Nominatim search page with a world map and no search results or details visible. There is no hotel name or supermarket distance provided on the final page, so the agent did not obtain or report the requested information (and the site view also doesn't show walking-distance data). Therefore the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
