## Intent

I will arrive Pittsburgh Airport soon. Provide the name of a Hilton hotel in the vicinity, if available. Then, tell me the the shortest walking distance to a supermarket from the hotel.

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows multiple searches for Hilton hotels and nearby supermarkets, but the final page snapshot is the Nominatim search page with a world map and no search results or details visible. There is no hotel name or supermarket distance provided on the final page, so the agent did not obtain or report the requested information (and the site view also doesn't show walking-distance data). Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use the located hotel as the origin for targeted nearby-amenity searches) because once I find a Hilton hotel I should search for supermarkets using that hotel's name/address for precise results. I will also use Memory 2 (use precise origins and a pedestrian routing profile) if I can get the hotel's address/coordinates so I can compute walking distance/time on a pedestrian profile. I will not use Memory 3 yet (flag mapping-source gaps) unless the map returns no supermarket results.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the located hotel as the origin for targeted nearby-amenity searches — I will use this (yes). The map already shows "Hampton Inn Pittsburgh-Airport" which is a Hilton brand hotel; I'll use that as the origin.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I will use the located hotel (DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pittsburgh Airport) as the origin for a targeted nearby-amenity search.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the located hotel as the origin for targeted nearby-amenity searches — I will use this (yes). The map already shows "DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Pittsburgh Airport", so searching from that hotel name should yield nearby supermarkets.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2: once I confirm the hotel's exact entry (name/address/coordinates) I should use that as the origin to search for nearby supermarkets and compute walking distance with a pedestrian profile. I will also keep Memory 3 in mind in case this map/search source can't find supermarkets — then I should report that and offer alternatives.
