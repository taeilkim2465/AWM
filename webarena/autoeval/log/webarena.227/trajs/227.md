## Intent

What is the price range for products from EYZUTAK?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the price range of EYZUTAK products. The agent searched and the page shows "1 Item" in the search results. The agent supplied a specific price ($9.99) for that single listed product and explicitly noted this reflects only visible results and offered to scan more pages. For an information-seeking task the agent provided the requested information (and the necessary caveat), so the execution meets requirements.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I checked the search results page for 'EYZUTAK'. There is 1 product listed with a price of $9.99. So the price range among the currently visible results is $9.99 (single item
