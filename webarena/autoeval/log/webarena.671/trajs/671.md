## Intent

Gather the titles of Sony Computer Entertainment VR reviews with 2 stars and less rating from OneStopShop, and post them in the games subreddit under the title "real user feedback on Sony Computer Entertainment VR"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the product's review tab and scrolled through several reviews, but the visible reviews on the final page are all 5-star. There is no action showing the agent filtered or sorted reviews by rating, extracted any review titles with 2 stars or less, or performed the Reddit post. The user requested two explicit outcomes (collect titles of ≤2-star reviews and post them to r/games under a specific title); neither outcome is demonstrated in the action history or final snapshot. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (search by exact product name) because it will help me find reviews specifically for "Sony Computer Entertainment VR" on One Stop Market. I will also use Memory 3 (compose community posts) later when posting to the games subreddit. I will not use Memory 1 (filter contributed repositories) because it's unrelated.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (search by exact product name) because it advises entering the exact product title into the reviews/search field to get precise results — that fits this step. I will not use Memory 1 (irrelevant: about repositories) and will not use Memory 3 yet (that's about composing subreddit posts later).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Filter contributed repositories and sort by star count): I will not use this — it's about GitHub repositories and not relevant to finding product reviews.
