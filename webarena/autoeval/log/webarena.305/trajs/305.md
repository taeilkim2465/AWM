## Intent

How many commits did Philip make in 2023/1?

## RM

Thoughts: The final page snapshot shows commits from March 2023 and the author filter box with "Philip Wong" typed, but no January 2023 commit list or counts are visible. The agent's message claims it inspected January 2023 (15 commits across Jan 3, 4, 5, 15, 18) and found 0 commits by Philip Wong, but there is no evidence in the action history or final page that the view was actually set to January 2023 or that those January commits were examined. Because the required information (verified January 2023 commit list filtered by author) is not shown and the agent's conclusion is unsupported by the page snapshot, the execution is a failure.
Status: "failure"
