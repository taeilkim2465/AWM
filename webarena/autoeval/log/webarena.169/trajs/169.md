## Intent

Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got the most stars?

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot of the "Yours" projects list (sorted by Most stars) shows The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com and Primer / design both with 21 stars and the roles "Maintainer" and "Developer" respectively.

The response supplies the requested information and offers appropriate follow-up, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"
