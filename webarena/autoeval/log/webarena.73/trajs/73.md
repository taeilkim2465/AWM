## Intent

What is the zip code of Columbia University?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task (user asked for Columbia University's ZIP code). The agent's last action was to ask a clarifying question about which campus, and the webpage search returned "No results found." The agent did not provide the requested ZIP code nor explicitly state that the information is unavailable. Therefore the task is not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Columbia University covers multiple ZIP codes. Do you mean the main Morningside Heights campus in Manhattan, or a specific campus/building/mailing address? If you confirm \"main campus,\" I will verify the official ZIP code (commonly 10027
