## Intent

I will arrive Pittsburgh Airport soon. Provide the name of a Hyatt hotel in the vicinity, if available. Then, tell me the the minimal driving time to a supermarket from the hotel.

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent correctly reported the Hyatt hotel on the page ("Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport") but failed the second part: it returned directions/time (134 km, 2:04) to a distant Giant Eagle (per the map) rather than finding the nearest supermarket and reporting the minimal driving time. The agent only offered to run a fresh nearby search instead of providing the requested minimal driving time, so the user's request was not fulfilled.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'The Hyatt hotel shown on the page is "Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport". The current directions on the page (to "Giant Eagle 1000 Airport Blvd"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items to guide the search:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1: yes — after confirming the hotel's details I'll search for a supermarket using the hotel's name/address as the origin to get precise nearby results.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use the located hotel as the origin) because once we confirm the Hyatt hotel on the map we should run searches focused on that hotel. I will also use Memory 2 (search using "hotel brand + airport name") because it helps target properties near the airport. I will not use Memory 3 since it's redundant with Memory 2.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the located hotel as the origin for nearby-amenity searches — I will use this (helps get precise driving time).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the located hotel as the origin for targeted nearby-amenity searches — I will use this (yes). The page already has the Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport set as the origin, so searching from that origin will give precise nearby supermarkets.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the located hotel as the origin for targeted nearby-amenity searches — I will use this (yes). The page already has the Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International Airport in the From field, so I'll keep that as origin.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the located hotel as the origin for nearby-amenity searches — I will use this (yes). It’s the most relevant for finding supermarkets near the hotel.
