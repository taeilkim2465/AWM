## Intent

Set my gitlab status as Busy.

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent filled the status text with "Busy" (fill('919','Busy')) and clicked several elements, but the final Projects page screenshot shows no visible status indicator or "Busy" label on the user avatar or profile area. Because the expected confirmation (status text or icon) is not present on the page, the status does not appear to have been set successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it's about filtering orders, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - I'll only use Memory 2 (use the on-page status as the source of truth and confirm on mismatch) to verify the status after I change it. Memory 1 (filter orders) and Memory 3 (open dedicated list page) are not relevant to setting a GitLab user status.
===============INFO - I will use the page's user menu (already open) to set the status. The "Set status" button (211) is visible in the user menu and is the correct next control to open the status dialog.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Filter orders by status..." — Not relevant to setting a GitLab user status, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Filter orders by status): Not relevant — this task is setting my GitLab status, not filtering lists.
