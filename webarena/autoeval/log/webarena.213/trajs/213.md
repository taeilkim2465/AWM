## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for key negatives about the Antonia Racer Tank. The agent's response lists lack of support / not suitable for high-impact, poor modesty / low coverage, and limited versatility, and cites review text such as "zero support" and "low impact class like yoga." The page snapshot shows a review titled "Zero support/modesty" with the text that directly supports those points; there are 3 reviews total on the page. The agent provided the requested information (with supporting reasoning) and offered sensible follow-ups, so the task is completed successfully.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Infer customer reasons from product attributes) — I will use this. If there are no direct reviews, I can map the visible product attributes (materials, fit, features, etc.) to likely customer pain points.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Infer customer reasons from product attributes): I will use this — it helps translate the review statements into likely product-attribute causes (fabric, construction, coverage) when customers don't explicitly state the technical reason.

9: send_msg_to_user("Summary of what customers don’t like (with reasoning):\n\n- Lack of support / not suitable for high-impact activity\n  - Evidence: Reviews say “zero support” and “definitely not good for anything high‑impact.”\n  - Reasoning: This points to the product’s construction (band, straps, internal support) providing insufficient lift/stability for running/HIIT. Even though the product is a performance fabric tank, the internal support (bra structure) appears minimal.\n\n- Poor modesty / low coverage\n  - Evidence: A review states “absolutely no modesty.”\n  - Reasoning: That likely means the top has low coverage, thin or slightly sheer fabric, or a cut that reveals more than customers expect — causing embarrassment or limiting where it’s wearable.\n\n- Limited use-case / low versatility\n  - Evidence: Reviews repeatedly recommend it only for “low impact class like yoga.”\n  - Reasoning: Because of the support and coverage issues, customers see it as useful only for low-intensity activities, reducing perceived value for buyers who wanted an all-purpose or higher-impact option.\n\nConfidence: High — two of three reviews explicitly call out support and impact suitability, so these are the primary negatives. One review is positive (likes color/regular rotation), so fit/appearance and fabric are not universally disliked.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Extract the full review texts to a file? \n- Search the storefront or other retailer sites for more reviews? \n- Suggest product changes (construction/material/marketing) to address these complaints?")
