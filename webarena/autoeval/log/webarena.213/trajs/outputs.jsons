The agent's response lists lack of support / not suitable for high-impact, poor modesty / low coverage, and limited versatility, and cites review text such as \"zero support\" and \"low impact class like yoga.\" The page snapshot shows a review titled \"Zero support/modesty\" with the text that directly supports those points; there are 3 reviews total on the page. The agent provided the requested information (with supporting reasoning) and offered sensible follow-ups, so the task is completed successfully.", "status": "success"}}
