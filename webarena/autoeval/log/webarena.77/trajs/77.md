## Intent

What is the total count of Pending reviews amongst all the reviews?

## RM

Thoughts: The page clearly shows "5 records found" near the Actions dropdown and the screenshot displays the Pending Reviews list. The agent's reply "There are 5 pending reviews in total." matches the page content, so the agent answered correctly.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'There are 5 pending reviews in total.'

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they remind me to check all pages (pagination) when counting reviews so the total is complete:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It reminds me to check pagination before concluding. The page shows "of 1" and "5 records found", so all pages are visible and pagination doesn't hide additional results.
