## Intent

I am at CMU Pittsburgh, how long it takes to drive to the nearest wendys

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task asking for driving time from CMU to the nearest Wendy's. The agent searched and returned an OSRM-derived result showing Distance 2.0 km and Time 0:03, gave the Wendy's address (5422 Baum Boulevard) and a brief route. The final webpage snapshot confirms "Distance: 2.0km. Time: 0:03" and the route steps, so the agent provided the requested information correctly.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Shortest driving result I found:\n\n- Conclusion: The nearest Wendy's shown is about 2.0 km away and takes approximately 3 minutes driving (OSRM estimate

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3 because they guide finding the nearest facility by geocoding the origin (CMU) and returning the nearest candidate with an estimated driving time and a brief route summary. I will keep Memory 1 in mind (useful if no driving-distance match is found) but I won't actively use it yet—I'll only apply it if the search/directions find nothing.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Useful — I will use its guidance to give a clear conclusion and offer next actions if no nearby Wendy's is within a short driving distance. So: use Memory 1.
===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide how I present the result and how I search:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to give a clear conclusion, nearest match details, and next actions; that's exactly what the user asked for.
