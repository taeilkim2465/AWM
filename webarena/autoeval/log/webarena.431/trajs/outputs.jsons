The agent did not perform the required cross\u2011tab comparison or select the lowest per\u2011unit item; instead it paused and asked the user to confirm whether to include bulk/multi\u2011pack/promotional listings and whether it may switch to other browser tabs (or to use only the current tab). The action history and final page show only a single product added ($28.99) and no normalization or comparison across tabs, so the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
