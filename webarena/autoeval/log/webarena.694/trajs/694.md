## Intent

Add a simple product named Energy-Bulk Women Shirt with 50 in stock, available in size S and color blue, priced at $60

## RM

Thoughts: The agent reached the product-configuration step but the modal shows a blocking error "Please fill in the values for price section." The Price input is blank (required) so the configuration/save could not complete. Although name, SKU and quantity were filled, the required price for the SKUs was not provided and the product was not successfully created with the requested size/color/price/stock. Therefore the task failed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 or Memory 2 because those relate to configuring configurable products and assigning sizes across color variants — here the user asked to create a simple product, so those steps are not needed. I will also not need Memory 3 right now because the Size attribute likely already contains size "S"; if the attribute option is missing the UI will show it later and I can add it then.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It describes creating/assigning variants for configurable products — our task is to create a simple product, so those variant assignment steps are not needed.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1, Memory 2 or Memory 3 because those memories describe workflows for creating configurable products and assigning sizes/options to variants. The user requested a simple product (single SKU) with a specific size and color, so the configurable-product variant guidance is not needed now.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Create or assign variant combinations and verify immediately" — I will not use this memory now because the user asked for a simple product (not configuring multiple variants). Memory 1 is relevant only when creating or updating configurable products and their variant SKUs.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 as reminders because they warn to explicitly add/assign size values to color variants and to verify created variants immediately — that is relevant if the "Create Configurations" workflow generates simple SKUs for size/color combinations. I will not use Memory 3 because it concerns adding a new attribute option at the attribute settings level (e.g., creating a new size option in the Size attribute). The requested values (size "S" and color "blue") are common existing options, so I don't need to create new attribute options now.
