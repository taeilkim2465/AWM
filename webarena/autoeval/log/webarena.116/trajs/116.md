## Intent

Show me the name of the customers who have expressed dissatisfaction with tanks products?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filtered reviews for the product "Tank" and returned the names of customers who expressed dissatisfaction along with short verbatim quotes, review IDs, and edit URLs. The action history (fill 'Tank' and search) and the displayed review rows (e.g., Trey, ID 125 visible in the snapshot) support that the agent retrieved relevant reviews and answered the user's request. The response therefore contains the requested information.

Status: "success"

## Final Response "Customers who expressed dissatisfaction with tank products (name — short verbatim quote — review ID / edit URL

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they instruct to report reviewer identity, an exact short quote, and a verifiable locator for any complaint — that matches the user's request to "Show me the name of the customers who have expressed dissatisfaction with tanks products." I will keep Memory 3 in mind (not using it now) in case I navigate to a page that has no reviews; it tells me to offer alternatives if there are no reviews.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It instructs to include reviewer name, a short verbatim quote, and a verifiable locator for complaints — that's exactly how to present dissatisfied customers once I find relevant reviews.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to report reviewer name, a short exact quote, and a locator for any dissatisfied reviews (useful for final output).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they instruct me to include the reviewer name, an exact short quote, and a verifiable locator for complaints — that's exactly what the user requested. I will NOT use Memory 3 because the current page already shows reviews (so the "no reviews" alternatives are not needed).
