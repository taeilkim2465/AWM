## Intent

Post a review of my recent reading "Love story" in the r/books with my comment "I cried".

## RM

Thoughts: This was a content-modification task (create a post). The agent filled the title ("Love Story — Review"), body ("I cried") and selected r/books as shown in the action history and preview, then attempted to submit. The page snapshot and the agent's message show a site error: "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." That means the submission was blocked by the site (rate limit/posting restriction) and the post was not created. Although the agent correctly prepared the post and informed the user with options, it did not complete the requested action of posting the review.
Status: "failure"
