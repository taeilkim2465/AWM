## Intent

Show the least expensive ssd hard drive with a minimum storage capacity of 1TB.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the least expensive SSD with at least 1TB. The action history shows repeated searches for "ssd 1TB" and selecting "Price" sorting, but the final page snapshot only shows the search-results header ("Items 1-12 of 504") and large product images — no product names, capacities, or prices are visible. There's no evidence a capacity filter (>=1TB) was applied or that results were sorted ascending by price to surface the cheapest qualifying SSD. Because the page does not display a specific SSD item and price that meets the user's requirement, the agent did not produce the requested information.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories to guide the search:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (refine queries): I will not use this now — we're already on search results for "ssd 1TB".
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will consider the three memory items:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 to guide narrowing the results (refine the search/filter) so I get SSD-specific items faster. I will not yet open product pages, so I will not use Memory 2 right now (I'll use it when I open a product to verify capacity/specs). Memory 3 (targeted search keywords) is helpful if the current filtering doesn't yield clear SSD results, but I won't use it immediately — first I'll apply the "Computers & Accessories" filter shown in the left sidebar to narrow to relevant items.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (refine searches with capacity constraints): I will not use this memory right now because we're already on a search results page; instead it's faster to narrow by the "Data Storage" category on the page. I'll keep the memory in mind if I need to run another text search.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (refine searches with device-specific queries): I will not use this right now — the current search results are already loaded and sorted by price; re-running a refined search could help but would add steps. I'll skip it for now.
