## Intent

Find the walkway to the closest grocessory owned by Amazon from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh.

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a walking route from Kenmawr Apartments (401 Shady Ave) to "Whole Foods Market, 5700, Penn Avenue" with Foot (OSRM) selected and turn-by-turn directions (distance 1.4 km, time 0:18). Whole Foods is an Amazon-owned grocery and the agent produced the walkway directions, so the requested path to an Amazon-owned grocery was found and displayed.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide the next steps:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use walking routing profile): I will use this — when I generate directions to the grocery I'll switch to the pedestrian/walking routing mode so the route shows walkways and sidewalks.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the correct routing profile for walkways — I will use this memory later when I generate directions, so YES to using Memory 1 (but first I need to find candidate grocery locations).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the correct routing profile for walkways): I will use this. We need pedestrian/walking directions so I must switch to a walking routing profile before generating the route.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use walking routing profile): I will use this — switching to the Foot routing profile is required to get pedestrian-specific directions.
