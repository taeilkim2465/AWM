3: fill('142', 'Hi everyone — I\'m looking for recommendations for a used iPhone (budget up to $1,000 USD). My priorities are: 1) daily driver reliability and good battery life, 2) excellent camera for photos/videos, 3) several years of iOS update support, and 4) ~128GB storage preferred. I don\'t have a strict size preference.\n\nWhich specific models (and approximate price ranges) should I consider buying used within $1,000? Any recommended places to buy (certified refurb vs. private sellers), things to check before buying (battery health, iCloud lock, carrier compatibility), and common pitfalls to avoid? If you need more details about my use or preferences I can share them — thanks!')

Which would you like me to do?")
