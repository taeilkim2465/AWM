## Intent

Show the most recent completed order

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows "Order # 000000180" with status "Complete" and the order date and item details visible, indicating the agent navigated to and displayed the user's most recent completed order. Therefore the task requirement is satisfied.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they describe the reliable procedure for finding the most recent completed order: filter orders by status "Complete" and sort by purchase/completion timestamp descending so the top item is the most recent. I will not use Memory 3 because it focuses on locating the latest processing order (status "processing" / pending), which is not relevant to finding a completed order.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it explicitly recommends filtering by order status "Complete" and sorting by timestamp descending to reliably find the most recent completed order. I will also consider Memory 2 (it reinforces precise filtering and selecting the top item), so I'll use aspects of it too. I will not use Memory 3 because it refers to locating the latest processing order (status "processing"/pending), which is not relevant to finding a completed order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It advises to filter by "Complete" then sort by date descending. The page doesn't show a status filter control, but the orders list appears sorted by date descending already. I can apply the same principle visually: find the first row with Status "Complete" and confirm its date before opening it.
