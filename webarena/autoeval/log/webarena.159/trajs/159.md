## Intent

I have a lot of Nintendo Switch game cards now, help me find the best storage option to fit all 31 cards

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent located a product page, extracted capacity (up to 160 cartridges), slot dimensions and external dimensions, and explicitly stated that the case will easily fit all 31 Switch cards while noting it's bulkier than smaller 32/40-slot cases and offering to find more compact options. The response gives the user the needed fit information and a clear next step, so the task is successful.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'I checked the product page: it lists "3ds case with 160 universal slots" (holds up to 160 cartridges
