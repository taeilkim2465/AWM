## Intent

How many commits did Steven Woodson make to a11y-webring.club on 2/6/2023?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent attempted to search for "Steven Woodson" but the final page snapshot shows an unfiltered commits list (authors shown are Eric Bailey, Adam Norris, Luce Carević, etc.) and no visible commits for 2/6/2023 or any entries by Steven Woodson. The agent did not demonstrate finding or reporting the number of commits for Steven Woodson on 2/6/2023, so it failed to provide the requested information.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to remind myself to verify the date format on the commits page (to avoid day/month ambiguity). I will not use Memory 2 because sidebar badges won't break down commits by author and date. I will use Memory 3 to rely on the commit history itself to count Steven Woodson's commits on the specific date.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm the date format) — I will use this. The date "2/6/2023" is ambiguous (Feb 6 vs Jun 2). I need to verify how dates are shown on the repository's commit list page before counting commits to ensure I match the correct calendar day.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm the date format): I will use this — the page groups commits by the calendar date shown (e.g., "06 Feb, 2023"), and I must match that date grouping when counting commits to avoid timezone confusion.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm the date format): I will use this. The page shows dates as "06 Feb, 2023" (day-month-year), so the user's "2/6/2023" likely means Feb 6, 2023; I'll match the page's DD MMM, YYYY format when counting.
