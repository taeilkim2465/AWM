## Intent

What is the zip code of Yale University?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for Yale University's ZIP code (information-seeking). The action history shows searches were attempted but the final page snapshot only displays a world map and no search results or address/postcode information. The agent's response did not provide the ZIP code nor state it's unavailable. Therefore the task did not return the requested information and failed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories to guide the search.
