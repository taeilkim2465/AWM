## Intent

How many commits did Eric make on 3/2?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent replied "Eric made 2 commits on 02 Mar, 2023", but the page snapshot clearly shows a header "02 Mar, 2023 3 commits" (and the agent did not open the commit details to verify which commits were by Eric). Because the agent's stated count for Eric on that date is unsupported by the visible page and it failed to confirm authorship, the execution is incorrect.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'Interpreting "3/2" as March 2 (the page uses day-month-year

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this — I need to confirm how dates are shown on the repository so I count commits for the correct day/month interpretation (e.g., Mar 2 vs Feb 3).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm the date format): Use it. The page displays dates like "02 Mar, 2023", so dates are shown as day month year — interpreting "3/2" as March 2 (03/02) is reasonable but I'll state the interpretation so you can confirm.
