## Intent

Modify the address of order #65 to 789 Pine Lane, San Francisco, CA, 94102

## RM

Thoughts: The action log shows the agent opened order #00000065, filled the street (789 Pine Lane), selected California, filled city (San Francisco) and zip (94102), then clicked Save. The page displays a confirmation banner "You updated the order address.", confirming the change succeeded for order #65.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Enter edit mode before making changes) because I must open the order's edit/view page and then the address edit interface before changing the address.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Enter edit mode before making changes) because the page shows editable address fields, so confirming we're in edit mode is relevant. I will not use Memory 2 (reporting format) right now because the user asked only to modify the address, not to present the billing info summary. I will not use Memory 3 (confirm before modifying non-shippable orders) because there is no visible order status on this address form and the user asked only to update the address; I will not change order status or tracking.
