## Intent

Check out the most recent open issues

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to check the most recent open issues (information-seeking). The agent clicked into the issues list and returned a compact summary of the most recent open issues (10 items), including titles, issue numbers, authors, labels, and update times, and noted "Open 21" which matches the page snapshot. The response provides the requested information and offers sensible next actions, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Here are the most recent open issues (compact summary

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it tells me how to present a compact summary of recent items (title, id, author, labels, last-updated), which is exactly what the user asked for. I'll use Memory 2 because the sidebar shows a badge "21" next to Issues — that confirms there are open issues I can summarize without extra checks. I will not use Memory 3 because it's unrelated (national parks).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 to present the open issues as a compact summary with title, identifier, author, labels/tags, and last-updated time — that matches the user's request to "Check out the most recent open issues."
