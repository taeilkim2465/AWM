## Intent

Show the least expensive switch card holder with a minimum storage capacity of 15 cards.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched and sorted by price and opened a product page showing a Game Card Holder priced $11.99, but the page/snapshot does not state the storage capacity or confirm it holds at least 15 cards. The user asked for the least expensive holder with minimum 15-card capacity — the agent did not verify capacity or show other options to confirm this is the cheapest qualifying product, so the requirement is not satisfied.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they remind me to open product detail pages to confirm the stated card capacity and internal layout (to ensure the product truly holds at least 15 cards). I will not use Memory 2 right now because the search is already device-specific ("Nintendo Switch card holder 15 cards"), so re-framing the search isn't necessary.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (use concise, device-specific search framing) because the current results are noisy; refining the query should surface relevant card case products. I will not use Memory 1 or Memory 3 right now (open product pages to verify capacity and layout) — those are important but apply after I find candidate products; I'll use them when I open product detail pages to confirm each item's stated capacity and internal layout.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will open product detail pages to confirm the stated card capacity and internal layout before deciding.
