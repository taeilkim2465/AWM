## Intent

Add the following users to repo millennials-to-snake-people as reporter: ['yjlou', 'a11yproject']

## RM

Thoughts: The modal shows both "yjlou" and "The A11Y Project" entered and the role set to Reporter, but the invite dialog is still open and the Invite button appears disabled/unclicked—there's no confirmation or member list update indicating the invites were submitted. The action log ends with clicking the invite control multiple times but no final success confirmation. Therefore the users were not successfully added yet.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 because it reminds me to confirm the exact repository identifier and that I have permissions; the project listing shows "Byte Blaze / millennials-to-snake-people" which matches the repo name the user gave, so I should open that project to manage members. I will not use Memory 1 (init README) because it is irrelevant to adding users. I will not use Memory 3 (post body formatting) because it’s unrelated.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (initialize repo with README): Not needed — this repo already exists and has a README, so I won't use this memory.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (initialize README) is not relevant for adding project members, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Initialize repositories with a README): Not relevant for this task (we're adding members to an existing project), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Initialize repositories with a README..." — I will not use this memory because it's unrelated to adding members to an existing project.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (initialize README) is not relevant for inviting members — I will not use it.
