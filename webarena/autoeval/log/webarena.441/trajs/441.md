## Intent

Update the project site's title to "GIVE ME SPACE"

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the project name field was cleared and filled with "GIVE ME SPACE" and a save/click action followed. The page snapshot confirms a success banner "Project 'GIVE ME SPACE' was successfully updated." and the Project name field contains "GIVE ME SPACE", so the title update was completed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Done — the project title is already updated to "GIVE ME SPACE". I see the success message on the page and the Project name field contains "GIVE ME SPACE". Would you like me to change anything else?'
