## Intent

DisLike all submissions created by Hrekires in subreddit news

## RM

Thoughts: The agent inspected the subreddit page and reported that each Hrekires submission shows score −1 with a "Retract downvote" button. The screenshot confirms multiple Hrekires posts on the page at −1 (downvoted). Because the user's goal was to dislike those submissions and they are already downvoted, the agent satisfied the request (and offered to search other pages if needed).  
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I checked the page: the Hrekires submissions in subreddit ‘news’ are already downvoted (each shows score −1 and a ‘Retract downvote’ button

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they recommend locating and acting on the newest matching items first — that fits the user's request to process submissions by Hrekires in the news subreddit (I’ll act newest → oldest). I will not use Memory 2 because posting/permission checks are about submitting content and are not relevant to downvoting existing submissions.
