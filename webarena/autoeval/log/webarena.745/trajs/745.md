## Intent

Create a new public project "awesome-llms" and add primer, convexegg, abishek as members

## RM

Thoughts: The project "awesome-llms" was created (the sidebar/title shows "awesome-llms"), but the three users are only entered into the Invite members dialog — the Invite button appears disabled and there is no indication the invitations were submitted or that the users were added to the members list. Therefore the request to add primer, convexegg, and abishek was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm the project is created and its visibility is set before managing members." I will use this memory — after creating the project I will verify the project page and its visibility before inviting members.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm the project is created and its visibility is set before managing members): I will use this — after creating the project I must verify it exists and is public before adding members.
===============INFO - Memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm the project is created and its visibility is set before managing members): I will use this — the page already shows "awesome-llms Public" and a success alert "Project 'awesome-llms' was successfully created." That confirms the project exists and is public, so it's safe to manage members.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 now:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 now:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm the project is created and its visibility is set before managing members" — I will use this memory. The page shows the breadcrumb and heading "Project members" for awesome-llms, so the project exists. Visibility (public) isn't shown here, but since we're already in the project's members page, it's safe to proceed with inviting members now. If visibility needed confirmation later, I could open project settings, but it's not required to add members.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm the project is created and its visibility is set before managing members" — I will not use this memory now because we're already on the project's Members page for "awesome-llms", so the project exists and the members UI is open.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they are relevant:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm the project is created..." — Not needed now. The project page is visible and we're on the Members view, so the project exists and we can proceed.
