{"id": 195, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This is an information-seeking task. The agent applied a \"Pending\" filter but did not return the requested total for the last 5 pending orders; instead it (incorrectly) reported \"0 records found\" and asked how to proceed. The final page snapshot clearly shows an active \"Status: Pending\" filter with \"10 records found\" and visible grand totals for orders (e.g., $76.40 and $183.50), so the agent's statement is wrong and it failed to compute the sum for the last five pending orders. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.", "status": "failure"}}
