## Intent

Create an orders report from beginning of May 2021 to end of March 2022

## RM

Thoughts: The agent set the interval to Month and filled the From and To dates (05/01/2021–03/31/2022), ran the report, and the page shows an Orders Report with intervals (5/2021, 6/2021, etc.) and "11 records found"—each interval displays "We can't find records for this period." That indicates the report for the requested date range was successfully generated and shows there are no order records for those months.  
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I'll use the past memories because they directly describe the correct workflow for generating an orders report in Magento:
===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories to guide this step:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): It instructs to use the reports module and date filters to run the report — directly relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Generate sales order reports via the reports module and date filters): USE. This directly applies — we are in the Reports → Sales → Orders workflow and need to run the report for the specified date range.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the application's reporting workflow (reports → sales → orders) and set the appropriate date filter or month selection to run the report.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it reminds me to use the Reports workflow and date filters. The From (5/1/21) and To (3/31/22) are already set and the report is visible, so I will proceed to export the report.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the reporting workflow and date filters — I will use this memory. The report is already generated with the requested date range (From 5/1/21 To 3/31/22), so this memory is confirmed as applied.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Generate sales order reports via the reports module and date filters" — I will use this. It reminds me to use the reporting workflow and date filters; the page already has the date range set (From 5/1/21 To 3/31/22) and the Reports module is open.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes. It reminded me to use the reports workflow and date filters — the report is already set to Period=Month and From=5/1/21 To=3/31/22, which matches the requested range.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): It reminds me to use the reports workflow and set the date range — the From and To are already set to 5/1/21–3/31/22 and the report results are displayed, so this is relevant.
