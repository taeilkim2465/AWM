{"id": 8, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This is an information-seeking task. The agent explicitly told the user there are no international airports within a 5 km driving distance of Carnegie Mellon University (and offered next steps). That response either provides the requested information (the set of such airports is empty) or explicitly states none are available, which satisfies the task requirement. The page snapshot shows search results/no results but does not contradict the agent's conclusion. Therefore the execution meets the success criteria.", "status": "success"}}
