## Intent

Where is the nearest tea cafe to University of Pittsburgh, and what is the walking distance to it?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the nearest tea cafe to the University of Pittsburgh and the walking distance. Although the agent filled search fields and selected "Foot (OSRM)", the final page snapshot shows empty From/To fields, no POI or route markers, and no distance/time displayed. No cafe name/location or walking distance was provided, so the required information was not retrieved.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memories because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this (yes). After finding candidate tea cafes, I'll run walking directions from the University location to confirm walking distance and time.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode): I will use this later to get an accurate pedestrian distance once I find candidate tea cafés. For now I won't run routing yet.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this (yes). It tells me to set a precise origin (University address) and compute walking routes to candidate tea cafes.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I'll use the mapping/routing memories because they directly apply: I should compute a walking route from the University's location to a nearby tea shop using the page's directions tool in foot mode and then read the returned walking distance/time to determine the nearest tea cafe.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this (relevant).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use walking-mode routing) — Use: yes. The directions widget is already set to "Foot (OSRM)" and the memory recommends computing walking routes from the university to candidate tea places; I'll keep routing in walking mode.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I will use a walking-mode routing tool to get an accurate pedestrian distance once I have candidate tea cafes.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I will use the mapping/directions tool in walking mode to get an accurate pedestrian distance from the University of Pittsburgh to the nearest tea cafe.
