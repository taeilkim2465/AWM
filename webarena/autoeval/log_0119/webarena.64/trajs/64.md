## Intent

Which customer has placed 2 orders in the entire history?

## RM

Thoughts: The Orders page shows "Active filters: Status: Complete" and "0 records found" — the agent left a status filter applied, so the view only shows completed orders and may not reflect the entire history. Because the user asked about the entire history (all orders), the agent should have cleared filters or queried all orders/customer order counts before concluding. Since the final page only shows no records under the active filter and the agent did not remove it or provide an explicit statement that no customer has two orders across the full history, the task is not successfully completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories before proceeding:
===============INFO - Memory 1 — Use: Yes. There is an active filter "Status: Complete" shown. To get counts across the entire history I should clear any active filters first.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. The orders view currently has an active "Status: Complete" filter — I should avoid answering from the orders list directly while that filter might restrict results. Instead I'll go to the "All Customers" page where the number of orders per customer is usually shown (so filters on the orders grid won't affect the customer order counts).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (check/lock filters): I will use this — the customers list currently shows "We couldn't find any records", so a hidden date/status filter may be active. I need to open the Filters panel and ensure it shows "All" / no date restriction before answering.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (check/lock filters): I will use this. We must ensure no active filters (date/status) restrict order history before answering. I'll open the Columns panel first (to show order-related columns) and then open Filters if needed to clear them.
