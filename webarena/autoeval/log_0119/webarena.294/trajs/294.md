## Intent

Show me the command to clone ChatGPT with SSH.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened the project's Clone menu, read the SSH URL shown in the page, and returned the correct git clone command (ssh://git@10.10.0.120:2222/convexegg/chatgpt.git). It also noted the SSH-key warning displayed on the page. The user's request to show the SSH clone command is satisfied.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Run this command to clone the repository via SSH:\n\ngit clone ssh://git@10.10.0.120:2222/convexegg/chatgpt.git\n\nNote: the project page shows a warning that you must add your SSH public key to your GitLab profile before you can push/pull using SSH. If you need help adding an SSH key, click the \"Add SSH key\" link on the project page or tell me and I can guide you."

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Common SSH clone command formats): Use — the repo uses a nonstandard SSH port, so the explicit ssh:// form is appropriate.
