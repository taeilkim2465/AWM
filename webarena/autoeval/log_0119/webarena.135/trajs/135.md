## Intent

How many commits did Eric and Kilian make to a11yproject on 1/3/2023?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only asked clarifying questions and did not proceed to open the a11yproject commit history or report counts. The final webpage snapshot shows a projects list, not commit details, and no answer to how many commits Eric and Kilian made on 1/3/2023 is provided. Because the task is information-seeking and the agent failed to retrieve or state the requested commit counts (or that the info wasn't available), this is unsuccessful.
Status: "failure"
