## Intent

Make all Aeno capri as out of stock

## RM

Thoughts: The intent was to mark all "Aeno capri" products as Out of Stock (a content modification). The action log shows repeated searching and clicks, then a select_option('notice-ROV5TGE','Out of Stock') and clicks, but the final page is the product edit screen for "Aeon Capri" showing "Enable Product: Yes", no visible "Stock Status: Out of Stock" or changed Quantity, and the "Advanced Inventory" link remains (where stock status is normally set). There is no clear evidence the agent updated the product inventory/stock status for all matching items. Therefore the task was not completed. 
Status: "failure"
