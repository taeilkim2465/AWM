{"id": 505, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The intent was to mark all \"Aeno capri\" products as Out of Stock (a content modification). The action log shows repeated searching and clicks, then a select_option('notice-ROV5TGE','Out of Stock') and clicks, but the final page is the product edit screen for \"Aeon Capri\" showing \"Enable Product: Yes\", no visible \"Stock Status: Out of Stock\" or changed Quantity, and the \"Advanced Inventory\" link remains (where stock status is normally set). There is no clear evidence the agent updated the product inventory/stock status for all matching items. Therefore the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
