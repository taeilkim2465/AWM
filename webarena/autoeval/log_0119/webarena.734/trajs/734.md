## Intent

Edit my post on Ted Lasso by adding a line to the body that says "Done watching. I love the renew!"

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent opened the post, filled the body with "Done watching. I love the renew!" and saved. The page snapshot displays that exact line under the post and a green "The submission was edited." confirmation, so the edit was applied successfully.
Status: "success"
