{"id": 168, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for repo full names with contributions by them that have >100 stars. The agent only scrolled/clicked and then asked a clarification about scope (own Projects vs any contributed repos and what counts as a contribution). Asking clarification is reasonable given ambiguity, but the agent did not provide the requested list or explicitly state that there are none. The current Projects page shows star counts (21, 21, 6, 6, 2, 2) and no repos >100 stars, but the agent hasn't delivered a final answer. Therefore the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
