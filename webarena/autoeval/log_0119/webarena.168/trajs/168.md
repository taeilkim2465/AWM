## Intent

Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got more than 100 stars?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for repo full names with contributions by them that have >100 stars. The agent only scrolled/clicked and then asked a clarification about scope (own Projects vs any contributed repos and what counts as a contribution). Asking clarification is reasonable given ambiguity, but the agent did not provide the requested list or explicitly state that there are none. The current Projects page shows star counts (21, 21, 6, 6, 2, 2) and no repos >100 stars, but the agent hasn't delivered a final answer. Therefore the task is not completed. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1, 2, 3 are about counting commits and filtering commit history by author/date. They are not needed right now because the user's question is about repositories with >100 stars where they made contributions (we first need to locate repo star counts and the user's role on each repo), not about counting commits by date. So I will not use any memory items.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Count commits by filtering commit history by author and date" — I will not use this right now. It's about counting commits on a per-repo basis by date/author; at this stage I first need to find which repositories have >100 stars.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about filtering commit history by author/date to count commits. That level of commit-count detail isn't needed yet; the user asked only for which repos (full names) they contributed to that have >100 stars.
