How much refund I should expect from my order canlled in April 2022, including shipping fee

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched the orders page and explicitly reported it did not find a canceled order in April 2022, then asked for the order number or permission to open specific April orders so it can calculate the refund. The final page snapshot does not show any April 2022 canceled order, so the agent correctly stated the information wasn't available and requested the necessary detail to continue. This is an appropriate and correct handling for an information-seeking request that requires more data before computing a refund.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I don't see a canceled order in April 2022 on your orders list. Please tell me the order number (e.g., 000000168

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I'll use the guidance to pick a single authoritative amount (I'll look for the "Paid", "Grand Total", or "Amount Paid" field and include shipping) so the refund calculation is consistent.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I will treat the "Order Total" (the authoritative amount shown in the orders table) as the starting amount and will confirm whether shipping is included or listed separately once I open the specific order. I will assume refunds should cover the paid amount including shipping unless the order details show otherwise, and I will verify that on the order page.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it tells me to pick an authoritative monetary field and confirm how refunds are treated; here I'll start by using the "Order Total" column (the visible grand total) but I will need to open the specific order to see the refund breakdown and confirm the shipping fee is included.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Specify monetary field): I will use this — it's relevant because to tell the expected refund I need to pick the authoritative amount (I will look for the "Order Total" / paid amount on the order details and confirm whether shipping was paid and included in refunds).
===============INFO - Memory check (will I use each memory item?):
