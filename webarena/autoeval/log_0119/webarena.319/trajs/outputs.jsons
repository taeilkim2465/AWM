{"id": 319, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent searched the orders page and explicitly reported it did not find a canceled order in April 2022, then asked for the order number or permission to open specific April orders so it can calculate the refund. The final page snapshot does not show any April 2022 canceled order, so the agent correctly stated the information wasn't available and requested the necessary detail to continue. This is an appropriate and correct handling for an information-seeking request that requires more data before computing a refund.", "status": "success"}}
