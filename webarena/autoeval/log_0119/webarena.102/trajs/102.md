## Intent

Display the list of issues in the a11yproject/a11yproject.com repository that have labels related to help needed

## RM

Thoughts: The agent did apply the label filter and returned a short list, but its reported results don't match the final page snapshot. The screenshot shows #1521 with the "help wanted" label on the current page, while #1478 and #1419 are not visible on the shown page. Because the agent's response lists items that aren't present in the page state (and thus provides inaccurate information for the user's request), this execution is unsuccessful.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I see the results for the filter "label:help wanted" on the repository. Here are the issues currently shown on page 1:\n\n- #1521 — [Feature] Add a broken link checker to the CI/CD pipeline — labels: feature, help wanted\n- #1478 — [Bug] 404s, bad host, timeouts, bad urls for URLs linked from website — labels: bug, content, good first issue, help wanted\n- #1419 — Investigate if <details>/<summary> is a good choice for our Checklist — labels: bug, help wanted\n\nThese are the items visible with the current filter/page. What would you like next?\n- Show the next page of results\n- Show all matching issues (go through all pages
