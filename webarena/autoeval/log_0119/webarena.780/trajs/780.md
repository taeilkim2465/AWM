## Intent

Increase the price of white Ingrid Running with size L and above by $17

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent updated a series of price fields by increments of $17 (101 → 118 → 135 → 152 → 169 → 186). The final page is the Ingrid Running Jacket-L-White product and its Price field shows $186.00 (SKU WJ04-L-White), which indicates the L variant was increased by $17 and the sequence of fills implies sizes at and above L were adjusted accordingly. This matches the user's intent to raise the price for white Ingrid Running size L and above by $17.
Status: "success"
