{"id": 219, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for nearby hotels whose walking route to Pittsburgh airport takes at most 3 minutes. The agent only set up a route (Foot/OSRM) and then asked a clarifying question to the user instead of returning the requested list or explicitly stating no matches. The final page snapshot shows a route with Time: 3:20 but the agent did not extract or report any hotel results filtered to <= 3:00. For an information-seeking task the agent must return the requested information (or explicitly state it's unavailable); asking clarification without providing the results means the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
