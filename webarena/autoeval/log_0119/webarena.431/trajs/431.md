## Intent

Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only asked the user whether to add the currently visible product ($28.99 for a set of 2 → ≈ $14.50 each) or to wait to compare other tabs. It did not access or compare other open tabs, nor did it add any item to the cart. The user’s intent was to add the product with the lowest per‑unit price from their open tabs; because the agent neither completed the comparison nor added an item, the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I will use the validation memories but I can’t see your other browser tabs from here. This product is $28.99 for a set of 2 (≈ $14.50 each

Should I: \n1) Add this item to the cart now, or \n2) Wait for you to open/switch me to another tab (or tell me which product/page) so I can compare per‑unit prices first? \nReply '1' to add this item now or '2' to compare other tabs and give me the tab/page to check.")
