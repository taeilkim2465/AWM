## Intent

What's the total number of items sold in the most recent 4 orders?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent responded with a total (16) and listed four orders, but the provided page snapshot only shows two recent orders (Sarah Miller 5, Grace Nguyen 4 = 9). The third and fourth orders (Matt Baker 3, Lily Potter 4) are not visible or verifiable in the screenshot, so the agent's answer is unsupported by the shown page. Therefore the execution is unsuccessful.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'The most recent 4 orders contain a total of 16 items (Sarah Miller 5 + Grace Nguyen 4 + Matt Baker 3 + Lily Potter 4 = 16

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — the dashboard's "Last Orders" list already shows recent orders with item counts, so I don't need the customers view.
