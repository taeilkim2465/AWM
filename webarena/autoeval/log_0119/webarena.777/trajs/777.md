## Intent

Reduce the price of green Hollister backyard sweater in all size by $5

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the product "Hollister Backyard Sweatshirt-S-Green" with Price $37.00 (the agent changed the price for the S (green) variant). The user asked to reduce the price for the green Hollister backyard sweater in all sizes. There is no evidence in the action history or the snapshot that other size variants (M, L, etc.) were updated — only the S-Green product was modified. Therefore the agent did not complete the task as specified.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Pre-calculate and format the reduced price): I will NOT use this memory because it describes calculating a percentage discount (15%), but the user asked for a fixed $5 reduction.
===============INFO - Goal: Open the product list so I can find the "green Hollister backyard sweater" and update its prices (reduce by $5 for all sizes).

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will not use the stored 15% formula (it's for percent discounts), but I will follow the memory's general advice to pre-calculate each new price (current price minus $5) before making edits.
