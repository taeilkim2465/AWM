{"id": 526, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent did not star any repositories. The action history shows navigation (opened a project and ended on its \"Starrers\" page) and then sent a clarification question to the user about global vs group scope; it never sorted Explore Projects by stars or clicked any \"star\" buttons for the top three repos. Final page confirms we're on a starrers list, not a starred-action result. Therefore the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
