## Intent

Star the top three most stared repos in Gitlab

## RM

Thoughts: The agent did not star any repositories. The action history shows navigation (opened a project and ended on its "Starrers" page) and then sent a clarification question to the user about global vs group scope; it never sorted Explore Projects by stars or clicked any "star" buttons for the top three repos. Final page confirms we're on a starrers list, not a starred-action result. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they are relevant:
===============INFO - We need to star the top three most-starred repositories on GitLab. Check memories:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It advises using the site's built-in "most stars" sort/filter — I'll try to locate the Explore/Projects view so I can sort by stars before starring repositories.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (use built-in sort/filter for "most stars") because finding a "most starred" view is the most reliable way to identify the top-starred repos. I'll use Memory 2 (scan star counts in the repo list) as a fallback once a list of projects appears so I can pick the top three visually. I will not use Memory 3 because commit/contributor insights are irrelevant to selecting repos by star count.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use list sorting or filtering to locate top-starred repositories — I will use this. If the UI has a "sort by stars" or "most starred" view, that's the fastest way to find the top-starred projects.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use list sorting or filtering to locate top-starred repositories — YES. I will try to find an "Explore projects" or a sort-by-stars option so I can view projects ordered by stars.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — prefer using the page's built-in "sort by stars" or "most starred" view to locate top-starred projects instead of manually searching.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use list sorting or filtering to locate top-starred repositories — I will use this. The best approach is to open the Explore / All projects view and use its built-in sort/filter (e.g., sort by stars) rather than scanning randomly.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use list sorting or filtering to locate top-starred repositories — I will use this. The page already shows a "Most stars" control and the list appears sorted by stars, so this memory is relevant and satisfied.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use list sorting or filtering to locate top-starred repositories — I will use this. It's the most reliable way to find the top-starred projects (look for an "Explore projects" page or a sort-by-stars view).
