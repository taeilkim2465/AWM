## Intent

Tell me the count of comments that have received more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the Worcester forum.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent returned a numeric answer ("Count = 0") but the final page snapshot only shows the post and "65 comments" — it does not show any comment list, comment scores, or a filtered view of that author's comments to verify the count. The action history doesn't clearly show an explicit action to view or filter the author's comments or reveal comment scores, and the agent may have misinterpreted "latest post" (the displayed post is 3 years old). Because the provided evidence does not confirm the agent actually checked the comments/scores, I cannot treat the execution as successful.
Status: "failure"
