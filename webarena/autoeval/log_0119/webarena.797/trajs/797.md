## Intent

Change the delivery address for my most recent order to 3 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA.

## RM

Thoughts: The order page clearly shows Order #000000170 status "Canceled", so the requested change to that order's delivery address cannot be performed. The agent inspected the order, informed the user the order is canceled, and offered the correct next step (add/update the address in the Account Address Book) while requesting confirmation of address details and whether to update shipping and/or billing. The agent handled the request correctly given the site state.
Status: "success"
