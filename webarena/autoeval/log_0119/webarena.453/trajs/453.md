## Intent

Disable Teton pullover hoodie from the site, they are facing some quality issues.

## RM

Thoughts: The intent was to disable the "Teton Pullover Hoodie" product. The final product edit page still shows the product fields indicating it is active: "Stock Status" is "In Stock" and "Visibility" is "Catalog, Search" (and there is no indication the product status was set to Disabled). The Save button is visible and there is no evidence a "Status: Disabled" change was made or saved. Therefore the product was not disabled.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify product relevance and exclude bundles/accessories): I will use this — when I find the Teton Pullover Hoodie listings I should verify the product type (simple/configurable/bundle) so I disable the correct product(s) and avoid accidentally disabling accessories or bundles.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify product relevance and exclude bundles/accessories): Use — I will apply this to ensure I disable the correct product (the configurable parent "Teton Pullover Hoodie"), not an unrelated accessory or bundle child SKU.
