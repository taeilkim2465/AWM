The final product edit page still shows the product fields indicating it is active: \"Stock Status\" is \"In Stock\" and \"Visibility\" is \"Catalog, Search\" (and there is no indication the product status was set to Disabled). The Save button is visible and there is no evidence a \"Status: Disabled\" change was made or saved. Therefore the product was not disabled.", "status": "failure"}}
