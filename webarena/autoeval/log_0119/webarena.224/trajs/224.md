## Intent

I am at CMU Pittsburgh, how long it takes to drive to the nearest wendys

## RM

Thoughts: The agent used the map directions tool with CMU -> Wendy's, and the final page snapshot clearly shows "Distance: 2.0km. Time: 0:03." The agent's message reported that 3-minute car estimate (and noted it's an OSRM/ideal estimate) and offered follow-ups. This satisfies the information-seeking intent.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I used the map’s directions tool. It shows the drive from CMU to the Wendy’s on Baum Boulevard is about 2.0 km and an estimated 0:03 (≈3 minutes

===============INFO - I will use the page's routing tool to get an estimated driving time and distance (Memory 1, 2, 3).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. It recommends using the page's routing tool with clear origin/destination; I used that.
