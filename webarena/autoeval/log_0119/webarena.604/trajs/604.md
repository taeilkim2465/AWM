## Intent

Post my question, "what is the SOTA web navigation agent repo", in a subreddit where I'm likely to get an answer

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted the agent to post their question to an appropriate subreddit. The action history shows the agent filled the title/body and attempted submission but the final page clearly displays "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The agent informed the user it couldn't submit and offered alternatives, so the post was not made. Therefore the task (posting the question) was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I can’t submit the post right now — the site shows: "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." This is a posting limit, so switching subreddits likely won’t help immediately. Options:\n\n- Wait and retry later (I can try to post for you when the limit expires
