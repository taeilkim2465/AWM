## Intent

Today is 3/15/2023, generate a sales order report over the last 45 days

## RM

Thoughts: 45 days before 3/15/2023 is 1/29/2023. The agent filled the From field with 01/29/2023 and the To field with 03/15/2023 and then clicked the Show Report button. The final page shows the date range correctly, and the report generation action was triggered. (Report results area is not visible in the snapshot, but the correct inputs and Show Report click were performed.)
Status: "success"

===============INFO - We need to generate a sales order report for the last 45 days given today's date 3/15/2023. Compute the date range: 45 days before 3/15/2023 is 1/29/2023, so the range is 01/29/2023 → 03/15/2023.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (reports → sales → orders with date filters) because it directly matches the required workflow to generate a sales orders report and tells me to set a custom date range.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (reporting workflow with date filters) is directly relevant — I will use it to set the custom date range and run the report.
