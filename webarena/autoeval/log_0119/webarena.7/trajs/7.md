## Intent

Tell me the full address of all international airports that are within a driving distance of 50 km to Carnegie Mellon University

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted the full addresses of all international airports within a 50 km driving distance of Carnegie Mellon University. The agent searched and returned Pittsburgh International Airport with a full street address (1000 Airport Blvd, Pittsburgh, PA 15231, United States). The final page snapshot shows Pittsburgh International Airport and no other international airport nearby; there are no other airports with international designation within ~50 km of CMU, so the agent provided the complete answer and offered to verify distances. This satisfies the information-seeking task requirements. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Pittsburgh International Airport (the international airport within 50 km of Carnegie Mellon University
