## Intent

Find a subreddit focused on topics related to city lives in DMV area, and post my question, "safe and budge apartment to live" there

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to find a DMV-focused subreddit and post their question. The agent searched for "washingtondc" (search results are visible) and then sent a message asking clarifying questions and permission to post, but it did not navigate to a subreddit submit page or actually create/post the user's message. Because the post was not made and the agent is awaiting user input, the task is not completed.
