## Intent

Tell me the the number of reviews that our store received by far that mention term "decent"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched the Reviews grid for "decent" and reported "0 records found." The final page snapshot confirms the filter with "decent" set and the table showing "We couldn't find any records." For an information-seeking task, the agent provided the requested information (zero reviews containing "decent") and offered next steps — this satisfies the requirement.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'I searched the Reviews grid for the term "decent". The results show 0 records found (the table also says "We couldn\\\'t find any records."
