How much refund I should expect from my order canlled in Feb 2023, including shipping fee

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task asking for the expected refund (including shipping) for a canceled Feb 2023 order. The agent only identified two canceled February orders on the My Orders page and asked the user to pick which order to open — it did not open an order, calculate the refund, or state whether shipping is refundable. Because the agent did not provide the requested refund amount or explicitly state the information is unavailable, the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I see two orders in February 2023 with status Canceled on the page:\n- Order 000000156 — 2/24/23 — $231.54 (Canceled
