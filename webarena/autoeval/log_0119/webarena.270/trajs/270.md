## Intent

Show me products under $30 in "men shoes" category

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows items in the men's shoes area and includes at least two products under $30 (Nautica Men's Athletic Slide $28.57 and ALAZA/ALAZA slippers $14.00). The agent selected the Price option and navigated within the men's shoes listings, and the visible results satisfy the user's request to show products under $30. 
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the hierarchical filtering memories to first open the broad category "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" and then drill down to the men's shoes subcategory (Memory 1 and Memory 2). I will also look for a sidebar or on-page category list if the submenu doesn't show the direct "men shoes" link (Memory 3). Now I'll open the "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" menu to find the "Men" -> "Shoes" links.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it recommends selecting the broad category first (gender) then the subcategory, which matches our plan.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (hierarchical filtering): I will use this. We should narrow from the broad category (Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry → Shoes) down to the Men subcategory before applying a price filter.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (hierarchical filtering) — relevant: I should try to narrow by gender then subcategory, so I'll try to use that approach if a "Men" or similar filter is available in the sidebar. I'll mark this as USE.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Apply hierarchical filtering: main category then specific subcategory" — I will use this. We already have the Shoes category selected, so next I should narrow to the Men (gender/department) filter before applying price.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the hierarchical filtering approach from memory to first narrow to the Men department, then find the Shoes subcategory and apply a price filter under $30.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use hierarchical filtering (main category then subcategory) — I will use this. We're already in Men (broad); next we should pick Shoes to narrow to men shoes.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (hierarchical filtering) — I will use this: it reminds me to select the broad category then the specific subcategory (we already have Shoes selected, so next is to find the gender/subcategory filter).
