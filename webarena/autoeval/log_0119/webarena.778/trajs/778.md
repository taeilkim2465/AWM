===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it, but adapt it — the stored instruction used 15%; this task needs a 13.5% reduction. I'll pre-calculate the new price as current * 0.865 and format to two decimal places before editing to avoid mistakes.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2, and I will not use Memory 3 for this step.
===============INFO - Memory usage:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It tells me to pre-calculate and format the reduced price before editing. I'll use it to compute the new price from the current $75.00 with a 13.5% reduction.

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2, but not Memory 3.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Pre-calculate and format the reduced price): I will use the idea of pre-calculating and formatting the reduced price, but not the exact calculation in the memory because it assumes a 15% reduction. The user asked for a 13.5% reduction, so I'll compute with 13.5%: current price shown is $56.12, new = 56.12 * (1 - 0.135) = 56.12 * 0.865 = 48.5438 => formatted to two decimals = $48.54. I will use this computed value.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to pre-calculate and format the reduced price. I'll use it to compute the new price and format to two decimals.
