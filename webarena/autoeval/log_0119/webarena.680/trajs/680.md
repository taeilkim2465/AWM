## Intent

Lookup orders that are on hold

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to Orders, set the Status filter to "On Hold" and executed the search. The page shows "Active filters: Status: On Hold" and "0 records found" with "We couldn't find any records," which explicitly indicates there are no orders on hold. This satisfies the user's intent to look up on-hold orders by returning the correct result (none found). 
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it's relevant: avoid returning completed/cancelled orders when the user asked for on-hold orders.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Match memory selection to requested order status" — I will use this. The user asked for orders that are on hold, so I must not rely on any cached references to canceled or completed orders (the current view shows Status: Canceled), and instead refresh/apply the correct filter.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. The user asked for "orders that are on hold", so I should ignore any cached references to completed/canceled orders and fetch the current list filtered by "On Hold".
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Match memory selection to requested order status): I will use this — it's relevant because the current active filter is "Canceled" and the user asked for "On Hold", so I must replace the canceled filter rather than reuse any cached completed-order info.
