{"id": 636, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user wanted the agent to post a request for DIY toolkit recommendations (budget $100) to the most appropriate subreddit.

However no submission was filled or posted and the final page shows an empty submission form. Because the post was not created, the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
