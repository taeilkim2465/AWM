## Intent

Post in the most appropriate subreddit and ask for recommendations for DIY toolkit products within a budget of $100

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted the agent to post a request for DIY toolkit recommendations (budget $100) to the most appropriate subreddit. The agent opened the "Create submission" page and asked the user clarifying questions (region/currency, intended use, new vs used, and permission to post to r/Tools/cross-post). However no submission was filled or posted and the final page shows an empty submission form. Because the post was not created, the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"
