## Intent

I want to browse the products in the Men shoes category

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows a product grid of men's shoes (product images, titles, prices, and Add to Cart buttons are visible), indicating the agent has navigated to and displayed the Men → Shoes product listing. The action history includes clicks and scrolls consistent with browsing the category and the required content is present for the user to browse products.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prefer category filters for direct navigation" — I will use this. The site has a category menu; selecting the appropriate category is the fastest way to reach Men > Shoes.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it instructs to use category filters to jump directly to the desired section; that matches the user's request to browse Men shoes.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use category filters for direct navigation — I will use this memory because it suggests using the page's category filters/sidebar to jump to Men shoes rather than broad searching.
===============INFO - Memory 1-3: All three memories recommend using the page's category filters or menus to jump directly to the desired product subset. I will use these memories because they are relevant — instead of broad searching, I should use the site's category navigation to go to the Men -> Shoes section.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories because they recommend using the page's category filters to jump directly to the desired section — that fits this task (browsing Men shoes).
===============INFO - We have three memory items suggesting to use category filters for direct navigation. I will use them because the page shows a "Shopping Options" category list and clicking the "Shoes (2523 item)" link will narrow to Men → Shoes, which exactly matches the user's request.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use category filters for direct navigation — I will use this. The page shows a "Shop By" / "Shopping Options" sidebar, so the category filters are likely available there and are the fastest way to get to "Men" shoes.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — the page's category filters are the fastest way to get to Men's Shoes, so I'll try to find the category/gender filters in the sidebar.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prefer category filters for direct navigation" — I will use this. It recommends using the page's category filters to jump directly to the desired section (Men shoes) rather than a broad search.
