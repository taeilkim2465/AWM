## Intent

Edit my post on Nvidia RTX 4090 by adding a line to the body that says "EDIT: This news aged well"

## RM

Thoughts: The user requested adding the line "EDIT: This news aged well" to their post. The action history shows the body was filled with "Crazy device for ML!\n\nEDIT: This news aged well" and the submission was clicked. The page snapshot displays the added line under the post and a green toast "The submission was edited." indicating the edit was applied successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Offer a concise, corrected title and body for better responses" — I will NOT use this. The user asked for a very specific edit to an existing post (add the exact line). Memory 1 suggests drafting an edited post for approval, but the user already specified the exact text to add.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 because the user asked for a specific short edit to an existing post, not a rewritten draft or title/body corrections.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Offer a concise, corrected title and body): Not needed — the user provided the exact text to add, so I will not use this memory.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 because the user already provided the exact text they want added and asked me to make a simple edit rather than propose an alternate draft.
