## Intent

What are the top-2 best-selling product in 2022

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the Year period and date range, ran the Bestsellers report, and returned the top-selling products using the report's Order Quantity column. The reply directly answers the user's request: it lists the #1 product and notes a tie for #2 (three products at 4 orders each) and offers to break the tie by revenue — so the user can get a definitive top-2 if desired.
