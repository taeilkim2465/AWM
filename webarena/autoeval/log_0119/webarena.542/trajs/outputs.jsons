{"id": 542, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent only searched for order 000000300 and asked the user whether to update shipping, billing, or both, and whether to change name/phone. There are no actions that open the order edit page, change the address fields, or save any changes. The final page still shows the order list (no address updated). Because the agent never performed or confirmed the address modification, the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
