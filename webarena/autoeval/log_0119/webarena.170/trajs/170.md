## Intent

Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got the least stars?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task asking for repo names with the least stars. The final page snapshot shows the user's Activity tab (created projects) but no star counts are visible, and the action history indicates the agent did not navigate to the "Contributed projects" tab or individual repo pages to read star counts. Without viewing star counts, the agent cannot determine which repositories have the least stars, so the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify contributions with concrete evidence): I will use this. The project list shows roles (Owner/Maintainer/etc.), but per the memory I should confirm actual contribution evidence (commits/PRs) on each repository page before deciding a repo counts as one the user contributed to.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify contributions with concrete evidence): I will use this. I should not assume contribution just from a username or role label — later I'll open candidate projects to confirm commits/merge requests authored by you. For now I need to narrow the project list.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify contributions with concrete evidence): I will use this. The user asked for repositories where they made contributions — I must confirm actual contribution evidence (commits/PRs/MRs) rather than assuming ownership from the Projects list.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify contributions with concrete evidence): I will use this. After opening the "Contributed projects" list, I will check individual repository entries (and, if needed, open their pages) to confirm the user's contribution evidence (commits/merge requests) rather than relying only on the list.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify contributions with concrete evidence): I will use this — I must confirm contributions by checking commit/PR metadata rather than relying on labels.
