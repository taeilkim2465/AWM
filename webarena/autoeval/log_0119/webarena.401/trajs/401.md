## Intent

Change my reddit bio to "Seeking SDE positions"

Thoughts: The biography field contains "Seeking SDE positions", the preview shows that text, the page displays a green confirmation message "The biography was updated.", and the profile sidebar shows the updated bio—these confirm the change was saved successfully.
Status: "success"
