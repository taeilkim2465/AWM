## Intent

Start a private project web_agent_android_xl with Android template and add primer, convexegg, abishek as members

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the newly created project web_agent_android_xl and the "Invite members" dialog, so the project was created. However the dialog's "Username or email address" field is empty and the Invite button was not used, so primer, convexegg, and abishek were not added. There's also no clear evidence the Android template was selected during creation. The user's full intent (create a private Android-template project and add the three members) was not completed.  
Status: "failure"
