## Intent

Tell me the closest cafe(s) to CMU Hunt library

## RM

Thoughts: The agent repeatedly searched for cafes/Starbucks near Hunt Library but the OpenStreetMap search results pane shows "No results found." There is no evidence the agent provided the user with names or distances of nearby cafes nor an explicit statement to the user that no cafes could be found. Therefore the information-seeking task was not completed successfully.
Status: failure

===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide the search:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it — it recommends trying multiple phrasings (e.g., "cafe", "coffee shop") to surface local results. I'll start with "cafe near Hunt Library..." and can iterate if no results.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (multiple phrasings / local names): I will use this — the site returned no results for my previous phrase, so I'll try a different query wording and be ready to iterate.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (multiple phrasings/local names): Use — it recommends trying different query formulations if initial searches return nothing. I'll try a simpler, direct query for the library name to get the map centered first, then search nearby for cafes.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (refine local-store searches with multiple phrasings): I will use this memory — it reminds me to try clear nearby queries and synonyms if the first search doesn't return nearby cafes. For now I'll start with a precise cafe search; if results are unclear I'll iterate with alternate phrasings.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (refine local-store searches / multiple phrasings): I will use this — trying a likely local/chain name improves the chance of surfacing a nearby cafe when generic "cafe near ..." queries returned no results.
