## Intent

Check out the most recent open issues

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the repository's Issues list with the "Open (21)" tab selected and issues visible (titles, numbers, and creation dates). The sort control is set to "Created date", so the most recent open issues are displayed. The action history ends with navigating to this issues list, so the agent reached the page showing the most recent open issues.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they directly apply to finding the "most recent" open issue:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the orders overview with filters and sorting to identify the correct "most recent" order — I will use this memory (applies equally to issues): confirm the list is filtered to "Open" and sorted by created date descending before opening the top item.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories because they explicitly instruct to confirm "most recent" items by returning to the list view, applying the open/active filter and sorting by date before inspecting any details. This matches the user's request to "Check out the most recent open issues."
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the orders overview with filters and sorting to identify the correct "most recent" order — I will use this (it tells me to check the list view and sorting before opening an item).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the orders overview with filters and sorting to identify the correct "most recent" order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the orders overview with filters and sorting — RELEVANT. I will apply the same approach for "most recent open issue": go to the issues list, set status filter to Open and sort by newest.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they remind me to confirm the "most recent" issue by checking list filters and sort order before opening details.
===============INFO - I will use the memories because they tell me exactly how to find the "most recent" open item reliably:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the orders/issues overview with filters and sorting to identify the most recent item — I will use this memory because it reminds me to confirm the list is filtered to Open and sorted by date before opening an item.
