What is the size configuration of the picture frame I bought 2022

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the size configuration of a picture frame purchased in 2022. The agent only clicked around, selected an option, and then asked a clarification ("Do you mean the picture frame from 12/14/22 (Order #000000184, $20.49)? ..."). It did not open the order or show the item's size, nor did it state that the information is unavailable. For an information-seeking task the agent must return the requested information or explicitly say it's not available, so this is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Do you mean the picture frame from 12/14/22 (Order #000000184, $20.49

===============INFO - Memory 1: I'll use this later when I'm scanning the order history list to set the page size so I don't miss orders in 2022. (Will use later.)
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they recommend increasing the orders list page size so I can scan past orders (including 2022) more efficiently once I open the orders page.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories about increasing the items-per-page so I can show more of the order history (to include 2022 orders) without excessive pagination.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It suggests increasing page size to show all orders quickly, but the page already shows "37 Item(s)" and the "Show per page" control is set to 50, so pagination is already sufficient.
