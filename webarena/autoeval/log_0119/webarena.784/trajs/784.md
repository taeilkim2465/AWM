## Intent

Tell me the email address of the contributor who has the most commits to branch main

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the email of the top contributor to branch "main". The action history shows multiple attempts to set the branch to "main", but the final page snapshot clearly shows "Commits to development" (branch dropdown = development) and contributor info for the development branch (SecUpwN: secupwn@users.noreply.github.com — 381 commits). Because the page is still showing the development branch rather than main, the agent did not obtain or present the top contributor email for the main branch, so the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will not use the provided memory items because they all concern verifying write access and branch permissions for editing — this task only requires viewing repository data (finding a top contributor and their email). So:
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1, Memory 2, or Memory 3 because they pertain to verifying write access and branch/commit workflows when editing or creating files — this task only requires reading repository commit/contributor data (no edits or commits needed).
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Verify repository write access and target branch before editing" — I will NOT use this memory. It concerns write access before editing; I'm only reading info to find a contributor email.
===============INFO - Memory check:

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about verifying write access before editing a repo; I'm only reading contributor info, not making changes.
===============INFO - I will not use the stored memories because they all pertain to verifying write access and branch context before making edits; this task only needs to read the contributor list for branch "main", not to edit the repo.
