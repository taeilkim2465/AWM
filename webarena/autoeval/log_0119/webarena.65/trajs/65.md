## Intent

Which customer has completed the fifth most number of orders in the entire history?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the customer with the fifth-most completed orders. The final page snapshot shows the Customers grid and the column-visibility dialog (8 of 26 visible), but there is no "Orders" (or "Number of Orders") column visible or checked. The action history does not show enabling an Orders column, nor sorting/filtering by order count. With the Orders data not displayed or sorted, the agent cannot determine who is fifth in total orders from the provided state. Therefore the task was not completed.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because the customers list with the order-count (total-orders) column is the reliable place to compute per-customer order totals. I'll also use Memory 2 to ensure the customers list shows the maximum items-per-page (so we don't miss customers on other pages). Memory 3 is less directly relevant because we're not reading the orders grid, but I'll still watch for any active filters or scope/date controls that might limit the customer list.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the customers view (with order-count column) — I will use this. The All Customers grid is the correct place to get reliable per-customer order totals and the order-count column may be shown/added via Columns.
===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide the search:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (customers view with order-count column) because it's the most reliable way to get per-customer order totals. I will also use Memory 2 to verify pagination — the page already shows "70 records found" and the per-page is set to 100, so all customers are visible on one page (no need to change). Memory 3 (checking date/status filters) is not relevant for counting total historical orders because the customers list's order-count/total-orders column represents lifetime totals.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — the customers view with an order-count column is the reliable place to get per-customer order totals, so I'll enable/show that column and then sort it to find the 5th-highest customer.

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use customers view with order-count column) — I will use this. The most reliable place to get per-customer order totals is the Customers list with the order-count / total-orders column visible.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because the customers view with an order-count/total-orders column is the most reliable way to find each customer's total orders. I will also use Memory 2 — the page is already set to 100 per page and shows "70 records found", so the full customer list should be visible (so pagination won't hide results). I will not need Memory 3 right now because I'm using the customers list (which reports order totals) rather than the orders grid, but I'll keep it in mind if I need to validate date filters later.
