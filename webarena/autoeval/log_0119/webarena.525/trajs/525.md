## Intent

Star the top four most stared repos in Gitlab

## RM

Thoughts: The agent did not perform the requested action. It only navigated (clicked) and asked a clarification question about scope, and the final snapshot shows a "Starrers" view (users who starred a project) with a sort dropdown but no sorting by star count and no repo starring actions performed. There is no evidence the agent identified the top‑four most starred repositories or starred them. Therefore the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'Do you mean the top‑four most starred repositories across all of GitLab, or the top‑four within a specific group/namespace (e.g. "Reasoning Memories"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use list sorting or filtering to locate top-starred repositories — I will use this. The page already shows a "Most stars" sort and the list appears ordered by star count, so relying on that is appropriate.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — the page has a "Name" sort control; I'll open it and look for a "Most stars" or similar sort so I can list repos by star count instead of scanning randomly.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use list sorting or filtering to locate top-starred repositories — I will use this. If you mean “top-starred” I should switch to a view sorted by stars (or the project listing sorted by stars) before starring them.
