## Intent

Invite yjlou as collaborator to solarized-prism-theme

## RM

Thoughts: The modal shows "yjlou" entered and the role set to Developer, but the Invite button is disabled (greyed out) and there's no confirmation or updated member list indicating the user was added. The action history includes repeated clicks but never a successful invite submission or success message, so the collaborator was not actually invited.
Status: "failure"
