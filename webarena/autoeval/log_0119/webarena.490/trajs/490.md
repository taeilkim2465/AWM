## Intent

Change the page title of "About us" page on my site to "Secret".

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the Page Title field was cleared and filled with "Secret" and a save click was performed. The page snapshot displays the header "Secret", the Page Title input contains "Secret", and a confirmation message "You saved the page." Therefore the title change was applied successfully.
Status: "success"
