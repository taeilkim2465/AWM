## Intent

See all public projects

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted to see all public projects. The agent opened the Explore page and opened the Visibility dropdown (showing options Any, Private, Internal, Public) but left "Any" selected; it did not choose "Public" or show a filtered list of only public projects. Therefore the task was not completed.

Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not useful — it’s about contributions lists and finding contributions elsewhere; we’re trying to view public projects.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it advises checking contribution lists if empty. I'm working with the Explore projects page, so I won't use it.
