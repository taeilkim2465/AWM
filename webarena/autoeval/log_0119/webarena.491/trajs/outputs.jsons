{"id": 491, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent only searched for \"Sarah Miller\" (actions 5\u201311) and inspected the order list (snapshot shows rows for Sarah Miller with statuses Canceled and Complete), then asked the user whether to (A) apply a Pending filter or (B) notify regardless of status. The agent never applied a Pending filter nor sent the notification message to Sarah, so the requested action (notify Sarah on her most recent pending order) was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
