## Intent

How many commits did kilian make on 3/5/2023?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for a specific count (information-seeking). The agent only asked a clarifying question about date format and whether to count author/committer, but did not provide the requested number or state that the info is unavailable. Asking a clarification is appropriate, but the task wasn't completed because no answer was returned and no further actions were taken to retrieve commits.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Do you mean March 5, 2023 (MM/DD

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because the date format (3/5/2023) and whether to count authored vs committed vs either is ambiguous — I need that clarified before I search commits so I count correctly.
