## Intent

Show all customers

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to show all customers. The action clicks navigated to the Customers page and the final page clearly displays "0 records found" / "We couldn't find any records," which explicitly indicates there are no customers to show. Because the page returned the requested information (that there are no customer records), the agent satisfied the user's intent.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. The customers view (with an order-count/total-orders column) is the right place to list customers and compute per-customer order totals, so I should open the customers list and later ensure that column is visible.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the customers view (with order-count column)..." — Relevant for later if we need per-customer order totals, but not needed for simply showing the customers list now. I will not apply it in this step.
