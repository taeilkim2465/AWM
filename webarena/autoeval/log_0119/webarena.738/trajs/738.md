Show me the way from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of Philadelphia 76ers in the 70th

## RM

Thoughts: The agent successfully entered Carnegie Mellon (Warner Hall / 5000 Forbes Ave) as origin and Wells Fargo Center (3601 S Broad St) as destination, generated and displayed the driving route on the map, and reported a clear summary (≈487 km, ≈5 h 44 min) while offering full turn-by-turn directions or other follow-ups. The webpage snapshot and action history confirm the route and directions are present, so the information-seeking task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (estimate with caveats): I will use this — I'll give an estimated distance/time with caveats and offer to fetch exact turn-by-turn routing if needed.
===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories:
===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories to make the route precise before recalculating directions.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide how I present the route and next steps.

Estimated driving time ≈ 5 h 44 min (Car — OSRM).\n\nNotes/caveats (per my memories): this is an estimate — actual time/distance can vary by exact start/end points, chosen route, traffic, and time of day. If you want a different CMU origin (e.g., main campus entrance or a specific building), I can redo the route using that exact address.\n\nWhat would you like me to do next?\n- Show the full turn-by-turn directions (I have them). \n- Use a different origin at CMU (tell me which). \n- Switch transport mode (bicycle, foot, or public transit). \n- Reverse the route (Philadelphia → CMU).\nTell me which option you prefer.")
