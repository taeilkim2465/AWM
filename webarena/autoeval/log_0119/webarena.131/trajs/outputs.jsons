{"id": 131, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the total items sold in the most recent 7 orders. The agent only paused to ask a clarification about which filters to apply (clear all vs keep Status=Complete) and did not retrieve order item counts or compute a total. No further actions or results were returned, so the requested information was not provided. For an information-seeking task the agent must return the total (or explicitly state it's unavailable), which it did not do here.", "status": "failure"}}
