## Intent

What's the total number of items sold in the most recent 7 orders?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the total items sold in the most recent 7 orders. The agent only paused to ask a clarification about which filters to apply (clear all vs keep Status=Complete) and did not retrieve order item counts or compute a total. No further actions or results were returned, so the requested information was not provided. For an information-seeking task the agent must return the total (or explicitly state it's unavailable), which it did not do here.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I can get that, but the Orders view currently shows 0 records because filters are active (Purchase Date and Status: Complete

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (sum per-order "items" and show breakdown) — yes, that's exactly how to compute the total and present the counts so the user can verify.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I'll sum the per-order "Items" values and present both the total and the per-order counts so you can verify.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 is relevant — I'll sum the per-order "items" counts and present the breakdown, so I will use it.

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (sum per-order "items" values and show a breakdown) because the user asked for a total across the most recent 7 orders and that method is appropriate. I will use Memory 2 (use the most recent completed order and its detail page) as needed to get authoritative per-order item counts from each order's detail view. I will also use Memory 3 to present a concise summary and offer next steps.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (sum per-order items and show a breakdown): I will use this — it's exactly how to report the total once I can see the orders.
