## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they help confirm the product quantity (81 count) and verify details on the product page before adding to the wish list. I will not use Memory 3 because finding marked-down items is not needed for adding an item to the wish list.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — the search result title already includes "81 Count", which confirms the product capacity matches the user request, so this memory is relevant and used.
