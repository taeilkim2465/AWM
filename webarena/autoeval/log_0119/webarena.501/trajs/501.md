## Intent

Make all Taurus Elements Shell as out of stock

## RM

Thoughts: The action log shows attempts to set stock status to "Out of Stock" (select_option calls) and clicks around Advanced Inventory, but the final page snapshot still shows the product edit view with the product enabled, quantity blank, and no visible confirmation that Stock Status was changed or saved. There's no evidence the Advanced Inventory stock status was updated for all scopes or that changes were persisted. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they are relevant to changing stock status safely:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify item attributes and current availability before reordering): I will use this — before changing stock I should confirm the exact product(s), SKUs, and current stock values so I don't modify the wrong items.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify item attributes and current availability before reordering): I will use this. Before changing stock I should open the Taurus Elements Shell product to confirm SKU (MJ09), product type, and current stock for the parent and any child variants.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify item attributes and current availability) is relevant — I should confirm each variant before changing stock. I will use it to check the child product's stock field when I open it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify item attributes and current availability): I will use this. I can see the SKU (MJ09-XS-Blue) and Quantity (100) on the page — I’ll note these before changing stock so you can confirm this is the correct variant.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify item attributes and current availability before reordering): I will use this memory — I should open the Taurus Elements Shell product edit page to verify the product type, variants, and current stock before changing availability.
===============INFO - I will consider each memory item first and say whether I'll use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify item attributes and current availability before reordering) — I will use this. It's important to confirm each simple-variant's SKU/quantity/stock status before I change them to Out of Stock so we don't modify the wrong items.
