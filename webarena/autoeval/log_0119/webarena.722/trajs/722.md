## Intent

Like all submissions created by Don_Gato1 in subreddit new york

## RM

Thoughts: The agent attempted to find submissions by author:Don_Gato1 in subreddit:newyork, ran multiple searches and the final page shows "No results for author:Don_Gato1 subreddit:newyork." Because no posts were found, the agent could not like any submissions; it instead asked the user how to proceed. The requested content modification (liking all submissions) was not performed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I searched the site and there are no results for author:Don_Gato1 in subreddit:newyork. How would you like me to proceed? Options:\n- Search site-wide for posts by Don_Gato1\n- Try alternative username formats (e.g., u/Don_Gato1

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check the target subreddit's rules and posting policy first" — I will not use this memory for the current step. It's useful before posting, but right now the user asked to find/like submissions; first I need to locate the posts.
===============INFO - Memory items:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory review (deciding whether to use each):
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check the target subreddit's rules..." — Not relevant for this task (we're just upvoting/liking existing submissions), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about subreddit posting rules and not relevant to locating existing submissions.
