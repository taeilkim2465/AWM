## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer high‑visibility local communities) is not relevant — this is about local posting and the user wants advice about sexual harassment in a relationships subreddit, not a local question. I will NOT use Memory 1.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2: it advises to choose the appropriate subreddit and check the community rules and flair/tag requirements before posting — that's directly relevant because the user wants to ask for advice about sexual harassment in a relationships subreddit.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (verify subreddit rules before posting) because checking rules and required flair is important when posting about sexual harassment. Memory 1 (prefer high‑visibility local communities) is not relevant — the user asked to post in a relationships subreddit, not a location-specific community. Memory 3 (cross-posting strategy) is not needed yet; first I should open the submission page and check rules/flair.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (Choose the target community and verify its posting rules) because it's important to ensure the post fits the subreddit and reduces the chance of removal. I will not use Memory 1 (Prefer high‑visibility local communities) because the user asked to post in a relationship subreddit specifically, not a local community. I will not use Memory 3 (cross-posting strategy) right now — it could be useful later, but for this step I'll just create a single submission in relationship_advice.

5: fill('143', 'Hi — I am looking for advice and support. My partner has repeatedly crossed sexual boundaries (unwanted touching and persistent pressure for sex) despite me saying no and setting boundaries. When I bring it up they often dismiss or gaslight me, and I don’t feel safe. I am trying to figure out practical steps I can take to protect myself, set firmer boundaries, and get support. Has anyone been through something similar? What helped you (phrases that worked, safety steps, resources, or support services)? I’m not asking for legal advice, just personal experiences and practical suggestions. Thank you.')
