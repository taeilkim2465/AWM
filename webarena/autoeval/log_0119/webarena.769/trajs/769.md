## Intent

We've received 378 brown Aero daily fitness tee in every size, please update the inventory.

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows "Aero Daily Fitness Tee-S-Brown" with Quantity set to 378, so the S (small) brown variant was updated. The user asked to update inventory "in every size." There is no evidence in the action history or final snapshot that the other size variants (M, L, etc.) were updated — only the S-Brown product is shown updated. Therefore the request to update every size was not completed.

Status: failure

===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide safe inventory updates:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm variant attributes before changing inventory): I will use this. I need to open the product record to verify the exact variant SKUs, sizes and color (brown Aero daily fitness tee) before editing inventory to avoid updating the wrong items.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 now, and keep Memory 3 in mind.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm variant attributes before changing inventory): I will use this — I should open each simple product (variant) to confirm SKU/size/color before updating stock to avoid mistakes.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (Confirm variant attributes) — yes: the page shows "Aero Daily Fitness Tee-XS-Brown" and SKU "MS01-XS-Brown", so I'm updating the correct variant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm variant attributes before changing inventory): I will use this — the page shows product name "Aero Daily Fitness Tee-XS-Brown" and SKU "MS01-XS-Brown", so I'm updating the correct variant.
