## Intent

Find the page of the undergrad college of the person who developed the Nash equilibrium on the map.

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted the map page for the undergraduate college (Carnegie Mellon) of the person who developed the Nash equilibrium. The agent filled the search with "Carnegie Mellon University" and clicked, but the final Nominatim snapshot shows only the default world map with no search results, marker, or college page displayed. Therefore the agent did not locate or open the college's page on the map and did not fulfill the request.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - We need to open the map place page for the undergraduate college of the person who developed the Nash equilibrium (John Nash). His undergraduate school was the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), and the user asked for the page "on the map" so they want the place page on OpenStreetMap.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (ask which type of page): I will not use this— the user already specified "on the map," so they want the map place page rather than an external university website.
