## Intent

Create a private blank repository called "web_agent" using the right template to speed up development.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the Project name and slug as "web_agent", set Visibility to Private, and checked "Initialize repository with a README" (visible in the snapshot). However it did not select any project template nor click "Create project" — instead it asked the user which template to use. The user's intent requested using the right template to speed development, so the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 (Confirm repository write access and branch context) because it's relevant to ensure I have permissions to create a repository before proceeding. I will not use Memory 1 (file-creation checklist) right now because we're only creating the repository itself — the checklist will be useful later when adding files. I will not use Memory 3 (fallback to API) unless the web UI is inaccessible.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will first decide which memory items to use:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (file-creation checklist): Not needed right now — it's for adding files after the repository exists. I will not use it now.
===============INFO - Memory usage:
