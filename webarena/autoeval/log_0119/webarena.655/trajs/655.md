## Intent

Fill the "contact us" form in the site for a refund on the iphone case I bought, stating that it broke after just three days of use. Also, ensure to include the order number #180 and the product SKU. Don't submit yet, I will check.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened the Contact Us page and populated Name, Email, Phone (left as "[your phone]") and the Message. The message includes the order number #180 but leaves the product SKU as a placeholder ([INSERT_SKU]/[insert SKU]) rather than the actual SKU the user requested; the form was not submitted (which the user asked). Because the user explicitly required the product SKU be included, the task is incomplete—missing the actual SKU (and phone remains a placeholder). 
Status: "failure"
