## Intent

Find the customer name and email with phone number 2065555555

## RM

Thoughts: The customers table in the screenshot clearly shows a row for Adam Garcia with email gamingpro456@gmail.com and phone 2065555555. The agent searched for the number and reported that exact name, email, and phone. The information provided by the agent matches the visible page, so the task was completed correctly.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Found customer: Adam Garcia\nEmail: gamingpro456@gmail.com\nPhone: 2065555555\n\nWould you like me to open the full customer record now or copy any of these fields?'

===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide the next action:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they instruct to search the customers list by entering the phone number into the customer list search field and open the matching row to view details — that's the fastest way to find name and email for the phone number 2065555555. I will also keep Memory 3 in mind (but not actively use it yet) so that after locating the customer I can confirm the results and offer to open the full record or copy fields.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it says to search the customers list first when given a phone number. The page shows the customers search field already filled with 2065555555, so this memory was followed.
