Instead of giving an incorrect refund, the agent explicitly stated the adapter is not visible on the page and requested the adapter's item or price and confirmation of non\u2011refundable fees before computing the refund. That meets the requirement to explicitly state missing information and ask for necessary clarification prior to calculating the refund.", "status": "success"}}
