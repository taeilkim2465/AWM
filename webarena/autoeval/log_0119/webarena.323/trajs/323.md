## Intent

How much refund I should expect from my order canlled in 2022/03? I only kept the AC-DC Adapter and the shop told me that I cannot get the shipping fee back

## RM

Thoughts: The agent inspected the order page (scrolled and viewed items and totals showing Subtotal $186.59, Shipping $20.00, Grand Total $206.59) but could not find an "AC‑DC Adapter" among the listed items. Instead of giving an incorrect refund, the agent explicitly stated the adapter is not visible on the page and requested the adapter's item or price and confirmation of non‑refundable fees before computing the refund. That meets the requirement to explicitly state missing information and ask for necessary clarification prior to calculating the refund. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'I don\'t see an "AC-DC Adapter" on this order page. Could you confirm which item on this order is the adapter or tell me the adapter\'s price? Also confirm that shipping ($20
