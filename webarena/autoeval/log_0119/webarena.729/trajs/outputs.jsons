The agent only performed searches (multiple queries) and ended on a search results page showing \"No results for author:AdamCannon\".

{"id": 729, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent never performed any downvote actions. The action history shows only search inputs (searching \"AdamCannon\" and \"UpliftingNews\"), a click, and finally a prompt asking the user to confirm whether to downvote and to sign in.
