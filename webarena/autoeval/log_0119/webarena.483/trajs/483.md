## Intent

Koushik wants to check my dotfile configurations. Please invite him to the repo as a guest.

## RM

Thoughts: The invite dialog is open with the role set to Guest, but the agent has not entered a username/email or clicked "Invite". The agent asked the user for Koushik's GitLab username/email and optional expiration/role instead of completing the invite. Because the final action (sending the invite) was not performed, the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I can invite Koushik now, but I need his GitLab username or the email address he uses on this GitLab instance. The invite dialog is open and the role is already set to Guest by default. Please tell me:\n\n1

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I'll not use Memory 1 or Memory 3 because those are SSH/clone reminders and not needed for inviting a user to the project. Memory 2 (clarify host/repo) is also not needed because we are already on the GitLab project page for "dotfiles" and can invite directly.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (SSH checks) because inviting a member in the GitLab UI doesn't require SSH/clone instructions.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (SSH access checks and permission reminders): Useful to remind the user after we invite Koushik so he can clone and check dotfiles — I will mention this, so I will use Memory 1.
