## Intent

Tell me the total cost of my latest non-cancelled order?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened Order #000000189 (status Pending, order date May 2, 2023) and reported the cost breakdown. The webpage snapshot shows Subtotal $749.99, Shipping & Handling $5.00 and Grand Total $754.99, which matches the agent's response. The agent answered the user's question about the total cost (grand total $754.99), so the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"
