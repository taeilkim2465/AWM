{"id": 29, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent identified the latest post author as Valalvax and inspected the comments area. The page only shows a single numeric score for each comment (likely net votes) and no separate upvote/downvote counts, so the agent cannot determine how many comments by Valalvax have more downvotes than upvotes from this page alone. The agent explicitly communicated this limitation and offered next steps (click score/permalink or query an API), which satisfies the requirement to state that the information is not available from the current view.", "status": "success"}}
{"id": 29, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The final snapshot shows the forum submissions list (post titles, submitters, and total comment counts) but not the comments themselves or individual comment vote counts. The action history ends on the listing page and no post was opened to view its comments/votes, so there is no way to determine how many comments have more downvotes than upvotes for the latest post's author from the provided state. Therefore the agent did not complete the required information-seeking task.", "status": "failure"}}
