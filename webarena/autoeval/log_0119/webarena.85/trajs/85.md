## Intent

From my stay at La Quinta Inn near the airport, what's the estimated driving time to reach Carnegie Mellon University?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled origin/destination, generated the route, and the page shows "Distance: 32km. Time: 0:30." The agent's reply correctly reported ~30 minutes (≈32 km) and noted caveats. This satisfies the information-seeking intent.

Status: "success"

## Final Response "The map’s routing tool estimates about 30 minutes driving time (≈32 km

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the map routing tool to get distance and driving-time estimates — I will use this. The page has a "Find directions between two points" link, so I'll open the routing tool and enter origin and destination.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 to run the page's routing tool with clear origin and destination fields. I will also use Memory 2 and Memory 3 to remember to report the estimated time with caveats (traffic, exact endpoints, time of day) after obtaining the route.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — the page's routing tool was just used and shows a result I can report.
