## Intent

What is the zip code of Yale University?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for Yale University's ZIP code (an information-seeking task). The action history shows repeated searches but the final page snapshot is the Nominatim search page with a blank/unchanged search box and a world map — no search results or address/postcode details are visible. Because the page does not display any postcode information and the agent did not navigate to or present a result containing the ZIP code (nor explicitly state it was unavailable), the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories:

===============INFO - I'll use the memories about preferring the institution's central/main mailing address and clarifying which campus I used.
