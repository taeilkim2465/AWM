## Intent

Update the description of Radiant Tee to highlight the real user positive reviews by quoting the comments

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the product description field (action 6) with HTML that includes a "What customers are saying" section and three quoted blockquote comments, then performed save actions (actions 7–11,12–15). The page shows the confirmation banner "You saved the product.", indicating the changes were persisted. This meets the user's request to update the description to highlight real user positive reviews by quoting the comments.
Status: "success"
