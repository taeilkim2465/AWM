===============INFO - We have to find all submissions created by the user "Hrekires" in the subreddit "news". The three memory items are about checking subreddit rules and tailoring posts; they are not relevant to searching for a user's submissions, so I will not use them for this step.

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check the target subreddit's rules and posting policy first" — Not relevant right now. That memory is about preparing posts; the current task is to find and like existing submissions by Hrekires, so I will not use this memory item for this step.
===============INFO - Memory review:

===============INFO - I will first consider each memory item and state whether I will use it for this step.

Should I proceed to reddit.com and look for Hrekires\'s submissions in r/news, and which Reddit account should I use (or should I use the currently logged-in account if any)?
