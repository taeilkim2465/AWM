## Intent

Fill the "contact us" form in the site for a refund on the bluetooth speaker I bought, stating that it broke after just three days of use. Also, ensure to include the order number #161 and the product SKU. Don't submit yet, I will check.

Thoughts: The agent opened and filled the contact form and correctly included the order number #161 and asked the user for the SKU, but it left a placeholder ([ENTER PRODUCT SKU] / <ENTER SKU>) instead of the actual product SKU. The user specifically requested that the SKU be included (and not to submit), so because the SKU was not added the task is incomplete even though the form was not submitted as requested.
Status: "failure"
