## Intent

Tell me the full address of all US international airports that are within a driving distance of 60 km to Niagara Falls

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for full addresses of all US international airports within 60 km driving distance of Niagara Falls. The action history shows the agent repeatedly queried directions between Niagara Falls and Buffalo-Niagara International Airport (the final page clearly shows a 40 km route to Buffalo–Niagara), and the agent attempted queries involving "Niagara Falls International Airport" but the final snapshot only shows directions to Buffalo–Niagara and no address information. The page does not display any full postal addresses for either airport, and the agent did not return the requested addresses in its response. Because the required information (full addresses of all qualifying US international airports) was not provided or confirmed for all candidates, the task is not complete.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they explicitly recommend verifying each candidate airport’s official postal address from authoritative sources and confirming driving distances before reporting results.
===============INFO - Memory 1, 2, and 3 are all relevant and I will use them:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they match the required workflow: obtain official postal addresses for candidate airports and verify they are within the 60 km driving-distance cutoff from Niagara Falls before reporting them.
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories — they all recommend verifying candidate airports by obtaining official addresses and confirming driving distances before reporting results. I will use Memory 1, Memory 2, and Memory 3 because they match the required workflow: compute driving distances first (using the map routing tool visible) and then fetch authoritative postal addresses (from official airport sites) for any airports within 60 km.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to verify candidate airports by fetching official addresses and routing distances; I will follow that workflow.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It instructs to fetch official postal addresses and compute driving distances before reporting — exactly what the user requested.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories because they all instruct the same needed verification workflow: obtain each airport’s official postal address and confirm it meets the distance cutoff by computing driving distance from Niagara Falls. Specifically:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It instructs to fetch official postal addresses and compute driving distances before reporting — this matches the user's request and my planned workflow.
===============INFO - I will use the memories because they instruct the correct workflow: for each candidate airport I must fetch the airport’s official postal address and verify the driving distance from Niagara Falls before reporting it.
