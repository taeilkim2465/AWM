{"id": 10, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for full addresses of all US international airports within 60 km driving distance of Niagara Falls. The action history shows the agent repeatedly queried directions between Niagara Falls and Buffalo-Niagara International Airport (the final page clearly shows a 40 km route to Buffalo\u2013Niagara), and the agent attempted queries involving \"Niagara Falls International Airport\" but the final snapshot only shows directions to Buffalo\u2013Niagara and no address information. The page does not display any full postal addresses for either airport, and the agent did not return the requested addresses in its response. Because the required information (full addresses of all qualifying US international airports) was not provided or confirmed for all candidates, the task is not complete.", "status": "failure"}}
