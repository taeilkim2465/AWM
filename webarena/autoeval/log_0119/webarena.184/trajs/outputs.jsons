{"id": 184, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for product names with Quantity = 0. The agent only inspected the products view, found an active filter \"Quantity: 10 - 10\" with no records, and asked the user for permission to clear filters and search for zero-quantity products. It did not clear filters or return any product names (or a definite statement that none exist). For an information-seeking task the agent must provide the requested list or explicitly state none are available; asking for confirmation without completing the search means the request was not fulfilled.", "status": "failure"}}
