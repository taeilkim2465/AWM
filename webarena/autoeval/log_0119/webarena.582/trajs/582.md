## Intent

Create a new forum named Cyberpunk, with a description of Welcome to the future, and include ['Games', 'Books', 'Movies', 'Future'] in the sidebar?

## RM

Thoughts: The forum "/f/Cyberpunk" was created (title visible) and the sidebar contains the requested items (Games, Books, Movies, Future). However the requested description "Welcome to the future" does not appear anywhere on the final page snapshot (only "Created 0 seconds ago" and RSS are visible). Because the description requirement is not met in the final state, the task is not fully successful.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prepare posting workflow..." — I will not fully execute that now, but I will keep it in mind for later steps when entering the forum details (so I know to prepare the description and sidebar content before submitting).
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as follows:
