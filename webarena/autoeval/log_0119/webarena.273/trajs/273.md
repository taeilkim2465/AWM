## Intent

Show me products under $199 in "furtiture with accent" category

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot shows "Accent Furniture" is selected (Now Shopping by Category: Accent Furniture), so the agent reached the correct category, but there is no price filter for "under $199" applied. The Price facet lists ranges like $0.00 - $999.99 and higher, and the page is only sorted by Price (top-right), which does not restrict results to under $199. No evidence the agent filtered to <= $199 or reported that such a filter is unavailable. Therefore the user's request (show products under $199 in Accent Furniture) was not fulfilled.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — I'll apply a price filter once I reach the correct category so results will meet the <$199 constraint.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use explicit price controls early): I will use this — after entering the Furniture subcategory I'll sort by Price so the results are easier to scan for items under $199 (the site doesn't show a direct $199 upper-bound filter in the sidebar).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (Apply the precise subcategory filter first) to narrow to "Accent Furniture" so results only include that subcategory. I will also use Memory 1 (Use explicit price controls early) by sorting the results by Price so lower-priced items appear first (there isn't a numeric upper-price input visible, so sorting by price ascending is the best available way to surface items under $199). I will NOT use Memory 3 (sort by price descending) because that would show the most expensive items first and is the opposite of what we need.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use explicit price controls early): I will use this — setting the sort to Price will help surface items within the budget more easily.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Use explicit price controls early) — yes: I should try to set a numeric max-price in the site's advanced search or price filter so the results are limited to <= $199.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use explicit price controls early): I will use this memory but not as the immediate first step — once I'm in the correct subcategory I will set the upper-price to $199 so results are already constrained.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use explicit price controls early): I will use this — after I narrow to the correct subcategory I'll look for a price filter or sort by price ascending so results meet the budget.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use explicit price controls early): I will use this — after narrowing to Accent Furniture I'll set the Sort By to "Price" so results show low-price items first (the UI also shows an ascending direction presently). This helps surface items under $199 quickly.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use explicit price controls early): I will use this — the page is already sorted by Price (lowest first), which helps surface items under $199 quickly. There isn't a direct "$0-$199" link, so sorting low-to-high is the practical control here.
