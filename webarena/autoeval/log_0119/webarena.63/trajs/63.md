## Intent

Which customer(s) has completed the second most number of orders in the entire history?

## RM

Thoughts: This was an information-seeking task asking which customer(s) have the second-most completed orders. The agent only filtered to Status: Complete and confirmed the page shows 153 records, then asked the user whether to export or run on-page searches — it did not compute or report the requested counts or state the information is unavailable. Because the agent did not provide the answer or a definitive statement, the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I see the page is filtered to Status: Complete (no date range visible

===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (check/lock date-range or status filters): I will use this. To answer "second most number of completed orders in entire history" I must ensure the Orders list includes all time and that I filter by the "Completed" status only (or otherwise count only completed orders). I'll look for/clear any date-range and set status = Complete on the Orders grid.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 now; Memory 2 is useful later when I report the final counts.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (check filters): I will use this. I need to confirm there are no active date or status filters so the result set is the full history. I can see the Purchase Date fields are empty and the Status combobox is blank, so there don't appear to be active filters — that means the grid is already showing all orders (308 records found).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (check filters): I'll use this — I need to confirm we're counting across the entire history and not a restricted date range. I can see the "Active filters: Status: Complete" and no date-range filter visible, so the list shows only completed orders but appears to include all time. I'll keep the Status: Complete filter since the question is about completed orders, but I must ensure no date filter is active first (none visible).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (check/lock filters): I will use this. The Orders page currently shows an active filter "Status: Complete" which is correct for counting completed orders; I should confirm there are no date-range filters restricting the history before answering.
