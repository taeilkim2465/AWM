## Intent

Start a private project project_site with NodeJS template and add primer, convexegg, vinta as members

## RM

Thoughts: The project "project_site" appears to have been created (we're on the project's Members page), but the invite modal shows an error "Please add members to invite" and the usernames field contains "primer, convexegg, vinta" with a red validation message — the invite button is disabled. That indicates the members were not actually added (likely the UI requires selecting each user from the autocomplete or entering addresses separately/pressing Enter). Because the member-invitation step failed, the user's full intent (create private NodeJS project and add those members) was not completed.
Status: failure

===============INFO - I'll use the memory items to guide this step:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm project creation and active context before modifying members" — I will use this later when inviting members to ensure the project page is loaded and I'm modifying the right project. For this immediate step it's not directly needed, but I'll follow it after creating the project.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm project creation and active context before modifying members" — I will use this memory. After creating the project I must verify the creation (and stay on the project's page) before attempting to add members, so I will create the project first and then confirm the project page in the next step.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this — it reminds me to confirm the project exists and that I'm in the project's context before inviting members. I can see "project_site Private" and the success banner, so the project appears created.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm project creation and active context before modifying members): I will use this — I should confirm the project exists and that I'm in its context before inviting members.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they remind me to confirm the project exists and that I'm in the project's context before inviting members. The current page shows "Project members" for project_site and lists the owner, so the project is present and active — these memories are applicable and satisfied.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm project creation and active context before modifying members): Use — the Invite members dialog is open and explicitly says you're inviting to "project_site", so this confirms the project context and permissions.
