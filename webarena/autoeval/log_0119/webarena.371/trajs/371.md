## Intent

Pull up the description page of Piada restaurant near Pitt on Map

## RM

Thoughts: The map shows search results and a Piada marker (and the search result for "Piada Italian Street Food, 3600 Forbes Avenue, ... Pittsburgh") is highlighted, but no place description/detail page is open (no details pane with full description/address/info visible). The user asked specifically for the description page for the Piada near Pitt; the agent only performed searches and selected a result/marker but did not open the detailed description page. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 because the user explicitly requested the place "on the map" — that means I should use the map application's search and open the place/POI result (the OpenStreetMap place page) rather than an external website. I will not use Memory 1 or Memory 3 for this step because the user named a specific restaurant ("Piada") near "Pitt" and did not ask me to find the absolute nearest POI or to compute routes yet.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories that direct me to search the map application for a place/POI (Memory 2) and to run a nearby/around search to find the closest candidate (Memory 3). I will not use Memory 1 because the user only asked to pull up the place/description page, not to compute routes or compare travel modes.
