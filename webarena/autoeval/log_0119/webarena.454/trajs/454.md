## Intent

Disable Ryker Tee Crew Neck from the site, they are facing some quality issues.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the configurable product and set "Enable Product = No" (screenshot shows it saved) and correctly reported that to the user. However, the simple variants remain Enabled (agent noted this) and the agent stopped to ask whether to disable variants or change visibility instead of completing the full removal from the site. Because the user's intent was to disable the Ryker Tee from the site and the agent did not finish disabling the simple variants or change visibility, the task is not fully completed.
Status: "failure"
