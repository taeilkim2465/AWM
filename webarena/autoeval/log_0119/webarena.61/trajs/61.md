## Intent

Tell me the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Sorrells Library

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the closest restaurant(s). The agent only performed map searches and centering actions (search fields filled, routing set to foot) and left the OpenStreetMap view open; there is no evidence the agent extracted or reported any restaurant names, distances, or an explicit "no results" message. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to return the restaurant names (and ideally distance/directions) or state none were found. Because the page snapshot shows the map but no presented list or reply with the requested information, the task is not completed.
Status: failure

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify "closest" by measuring distance or using routing tools): I will use this. After finding candidate restaurants I'll measure walking distances or use directions from the anchored location to confirm which are actually closest rather than relying on search order.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify distances): I will use this later to confirm which restaurants are actually closest once I have candidate locations. So I will not apply it right now but I'll keep it for distance checks.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. I will verify "closest" by measuring distances or using routing tools after finding candidate restaurants so the ranking is accurate.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify "closest" by measuring distance or using routing tools): I will use this. The search order on the map may not reflect true proximity, so I should use the map's directions/distance tools to measure walking distances from Sorrells Library to candidate restaurants before declaring which are closest.
===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories to guide the next actions.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items to guide the next steps:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify "closest" by measuring distance or using routing tools): I will use this. Since search listing order may not equal actual proximity, I should measure walking distances or use directions to confirm which restaurants are actually closest.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 to anchor searches to a precise location (set the "From" field to Sorrells Library) so nearby queries are centered correctly. I'll also use Memory 1 to verify actual proximity (I'll request walking directions/distances after finding candidates). Memory 2 is a useful fallback if the library name isn't recognized — I won't use it yet but will keep it in mind.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this — after finding candidate restaurants I should verify actual proximity by measuring/routing (walking) from the anchored location rather than trusting result order.
