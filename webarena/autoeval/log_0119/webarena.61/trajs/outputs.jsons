{"id": 61, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the closest restaurant(s). The agent only performed map searches and centering actions (search fields filled, routing set to foot) and left the OpenStreetMap view open; there is no evidence the agent extracted or reported any restaurant names, distances, or an explicit \"no results\" message. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to return the restaurant names (and ideally distance/directions) or state none were found. Because the page snapshot shows the map but no presented list or reply with the requested information, the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
