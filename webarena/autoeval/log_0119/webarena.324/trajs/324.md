## Intent

Show me the "chairs" listings by ascending price.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for "chairs", set the Sort By dropdown to "Price" and the page shows "Sort By Price" with an upward arrow beside the selector (indicating ascending order). The results list "Search results for: 'chairs'" with items displayed, so the listings are sorted by ascending price as requested.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Sort by price high-to-low" — I will NOT use this memory because the user asked for ascending (low-to-high) price order.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll consider the memory items before acting.
