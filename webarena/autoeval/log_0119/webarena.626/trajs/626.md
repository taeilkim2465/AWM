Wait a while before trying again.\" I used Memory 1 (keep title concise and body minimal) and Memory 2 (selected a broad community), and I’ll apply Memory 3 by offering next steps.\n\nYour current draft:\n- Title: iPhone 14\n- Body: your opinion\n- Forum: iphone\n\nWhat would you like me to do next? Options:\n1) Wait and retry posting now (I can try again if you tell me when). \n2) Retry posting to the same forum immediately (likely to fail due to the limit). \n3) Cross-post to another high-traffic community (suggestions: r/iphone, r/apple, r/AskReddit) — tell me which one. \n4) Edit the title/body before posting (tell me changes). \n5) Save this as a draft or copy the text so you can post later or from another account.\n6) Cancel and do nothing.\n\nPick an option or tell me another preference and I’ll take the next action.")
