## Intent

Reduce the price of this product by 10%

## RM

Thoughts: The price field now shows $62.10 and the agent cleared and filled the price field with 62.10 then clicked the save control. A 10% reduction from the likely original $69.00 equals $62.10, so the agent set the correct reduced price and attempted to save. The final page state confirms the price is 62.10.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I should verify whether the displayed price is per-unit, for a bundle, or a special/subscription price before changing it. The product edit page is already open, so I'll look for the price field and any bundle/quantity info.
