{"id": 218, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for walking distances from nearby hotels to CMU within \u22645 minutes (information-seeking). The agent repeatedly opened the directions/search UI and selected \"Foot (OSRM)\", but never filled origin/destination or ran routes for hotels; the map snapshot shows empty From/To fields and no results. Instead the agent sent a clarifying question about using OSRM vs assumed speed and how many hotels to show. It did not return the requested distances or explicitly say the information is unavailable, so the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
