## Intent

Make all Selene yoga hoodie as out of stock

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filtered the catalog for "Selene yoga hoodie" (active filter visible) with the results set to show up to 200 per page (so all 16 records would be visible). The action sequence set quantity to 0 and chose "Out of Stock". The snapshot shows the Selene items with Quantity 0.0000 and Salable Quantity indicated as "Default Stock: 0" for the visible rows, which confirms the products are out of stock. This matches the user's intent to make all Selene yoga hoodie items out of stock.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it tells me to set quantity to 0 and change stock status to "Out of Stock" then save — that's exactly what's needed to mark items unavailable. I will NOT use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because those are about verifying items before reordering and aren't relevant to marking products out of stock.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it gives the exact reliable procedure to mark a product out of stock (set quantity to 0 and change stock status to "Out of Stock", then save). I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because those are about verifying items before reordering, which is not needed for this task of marking products out of stock.

===============INFO - Memory 1 is directly relevant: it says to set quantity to 0 and stock status to "Out of Stock" and then save. I will use Memory 1 to ensure each Selene Yoga Hoodie variant is marked out of stock.
