## Intent

Show me the way from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of Boston home NBA team 

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for a route from Carnegie Mellon University to Boston's NBA home stadium. The action history shows the agent filled origin (Carnegie Mellon) and destination (TD Garden) and clicked "Go". The final page snapshot, however, only shows a marker at TD Garden and no route line, no origin marker visible on the map, and no turn-by-turn directions or route summary in the sidebar. Because the requested directions were not produced or displayed, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"
