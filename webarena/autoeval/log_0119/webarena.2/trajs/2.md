## Intent

What is the top-1 best-selling product type in Quarter 1 2022

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent set the correct date range (1/1/22–3/31/22), specified the ranking metric (Order Quantity), ran the Bestsellers report, and returned the result: there is no single top-1 — five products tie with 2 orders each (listed with counts). The agent also offered sensible next steps (break tie by revenue or export). The response provides the requested information, so the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I used the report's ranking metric: Order Quantity.\n\nResult for Q1 2022 (1/1/22–3/31/22

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I should verify which metric the report uses (units sold, orders, or revenue) before declaring a best‑seller.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2: they remind me to confirm which ranking metric the Bestsellers report uses (units, orders, or revenue) by checking column headers or report settings before reporting the top item. I will not use Memory 3 right now — exporting/aggregating isn't necessary unless the report UI lacks the needed metric, is paginated, or doesn't provide the full Q1 2022 data; if that happens I'll export and compute totals externally.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to confirm the ranking metric. The table shows a column header "Order Quantity", so I'll use that metric.
