## Intent

Change the page title of "Privacy Policy" page on my site to "No privacy policy is needed is this dystopian world".

## RM

Thoughts: The action sequence cleared and filled the Page Title field and clicked Save. The page shows the updated title in the header and in the Page Title input, plus a success notice "You saved the page." This confirms the "Privacy Policy" page title was changed to "No privacy policy is needed is this dystopian world."
Status: "success"
