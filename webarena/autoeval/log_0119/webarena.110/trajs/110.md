## Intent

Presents the monthly count of successful orders from Jan to Nov 2022 in MM:COUNT format

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied filters (Status: Complete, Purchase Date 01/01/2022–11/30/2022) and opened the export dialog (105 records found) but did not compute or present the monthly counts. Instead it asked a clarification about CSV/order IDs. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to return the MM:COUNT summary (or state it was unavailable). Because the requested MM:COUNT output was not provided, the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"
