{"id": 782, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The action history only shows edits on a single product page (Atomic Endurance Running Tee V-neck - XS - Blue) \u2014 filling prices 34.44, 42.36, then 52.10 \u2014 and the final screenshot is that XS-Blue product with Price $52.10. There is no evidence the agent navigated to or updated the small (S) size or any other \"blue running tshirt\" products, nor did the agent click the Save button to persist changes. Also the 23% increase from the prior value (42.36 * 1.23 \u2248 52.16) doesn't exactly match the set value $52.10. Therefore the task (increase price for all blue running tshirts in XS and S by 23%) was not completed successfully.", "status": "failure"}}
