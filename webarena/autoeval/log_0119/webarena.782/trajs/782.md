## Intent

Increase the price of all blue running tshirts in extra small and small sizes by 23%

## RM

Thoughts: The action history only shows edits on a single product page (Atomic Endurance Running Tee V-neck - XS - Blue) — filling prices 34.44, 42.36, then 52.10 — and the final screenshot is that XS-Blue product with Price $52.10. There is no evidence the agent navigated to or updated the small (S) size or any other "blue running tshirt" products, nor did the agent click the Save button to persist changes. Also the 23% increase from the prior value (42.36 * 1.23 ≈ 52.16) doesn't exactly match the set value $52.10. Therefore the task (increase price for all blue running tshirts in XS and S by 23%) was not completed successfully. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as guidance:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Pre-calculate and format new fixed-dollar prices before editing" — I will use this idea (yes). Although this task is a percentage increase (not fixed-dollar), pre-calculating and preparing a small list of original → new prices for each affected variant will prevent on-the-fly errors.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Pre-calculate and format new fixed-dollar prices before editing" — I will not use this memory because our change is a percentage increase (23%), not a flat-dollar adjustment.
===============INFO - Memory items — decide whether to use them now:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I'll pre-calculate new prices before editing to avoid mistakes.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. I will pre-calculate and format the new fixed-dollar prices before editing to avoid on-the-fly math errors.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It tells me to pre-calculate and format new prices ahead of editing — I'll use it to avoid mistakes.
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Pre-calculate and format new fixed-dollar prices): I will use this. It reminds me to compute and format the new prices ahead of editing to avoid mistakes.
