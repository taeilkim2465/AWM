## Intent

Draft an email to the shop owner via their contact us function for a coupon as my refund is suppoed to be replaced by a coupon

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened the Contact Us page and populated the contact form with the drafted message (the page shows the Name and Email filled and the message textarea contains the user's signature at the bottom with a scrollbar indicating the full draft is present but scrolled). The user asked to draft an email via the contact form — filling the form accomplishes that (sending wasn't requested). Therefore the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"
