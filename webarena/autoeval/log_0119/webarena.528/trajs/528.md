## Intent

Draft a refund message via their "contact us" form for the phone screen protector I bought March 2023. It broke after three days of use. The shop requires the order id, the reason and the amount to refund in the message. Don't submit yet

## RM

Thoughts: The agent produced a clear refund message draft that includes the required order ID, reason for refund, and refund amount placeholders, asks for confirmation about shipping/taxes, offers to attach photos and requests return instructions — and it did not submit the form. The webpage snapshot doesn't contradict or affect the draft. Therefore the task was completed as requested.

Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. It reminds me to ask you to confirm the exact item identity (if the order page isn't clear) and whether any fees (shipping/restocking) are non‑refundable before finalizing the refund amount. I'll ask you to confirm those.
