## Intent

Delete all pending negative reviews for Circe fleece

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only opened the Marketing menu (showing "Pending Reviews") by clicking; there is no evidence it navigated to Pending Reviews, filtered for "Circe fleece", selected any reviews, or performed delete actions. The final page still shows the menu overlay and no confirmation or list of deleted reviews, so the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 ("Handle zero-review results..."): Not needed now — I expect there are reviews for the product and I will search for them. If no results appear later, I'll use the guidance from Memory 1 then.
