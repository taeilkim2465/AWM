## Intent

Reduce the price of yellow shirts from Gwyn Endurance in all size below L by 15%

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot and action history show the agent edited the Gwyn Endurance Tee-XS-Yellow product price to $14.74 (which corresponds to a 15% reduction from $17.34), but there is no evidence the agent navigated to or updated the other size variants (S and M) or any other "below L" SKUs. The user requested applying the 15% reduction to all sizes below L; only the XS product was changed, so the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Pre-calculate and format the reduced price): I will use this — we need to compute each variant's new price (current * 0.85) and format to the store currency precision before editing.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they remind me to pre-calculate the 15% reduced prices and enter the final calculated value in one step (this prevents compounding or formatting errors). I will not use Memory 3 because it refers to fixed-dollar reductions, which is not applicable here.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I will pre-calculate the discounted prices (current * 0.85) and format to two decimals before making edits.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Pre-calculate and format the reduced price): I will use this. I should read each variant's current price and compute new_price = current_price * 0.85, formatted to two decimals/currency before editing so I don't mistype values.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I will pre-calculate the discounted price (new = current * 0.85) before making edits to avoid mistakes.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they remind me to pre-calculate and format the discounted price (single-step calculation, two-decimal formatting) before editing — that prevents compounding or input mistakes. I will not use Memory 3 because it’s about fixed-dollar reductions (not relevant; this is a percentage reduction).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Pre-calculate and format the reduced price): I will use this. I need to compute the 15% reduction and format it correctly before entering it into the Price field.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to ensure I compute and enter the discounted price correctly, and I will not use Memory 3 because this is a percentage reduction, not a fixed-dollar change.
