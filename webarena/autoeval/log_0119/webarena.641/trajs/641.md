## Intent

Post a notice on a virtual meetup for Harry Potter enthusiasts on July 8th in the books subreddit

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked the agent to post a meetup notice to r/books for July 8. The agent only clicked into the submission form and then sent a message asking for details (time/timezone, platform/link, whether to draft, tone, and rule-check), but it did not fill in the title/body, select the forum, or submit the post. The final page snapshot shows an empty "Create submission" form. Because the post was not created and the action sequence stopped awaiting user details, the task of posting the notice was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items that say to verify community rules and pick the best-fit posting strategy (Memory 1, Memory 2, Memory 3). They are relevant because I should check the books subreddit’s rules and any flair/formatting requirements before posting the meetup notice to avoid removal.
