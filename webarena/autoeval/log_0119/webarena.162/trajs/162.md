## Intent

I have a lot of Nintendo Switch game cards now, help me find the best storage option to fit all 40 cards

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the best storage option for 40 Nintendo Switch cards (information-seeking). The agent's final message gives a clear recommendation (best = 40-slot case, next-best = 48-slot), other viable options (binders, trays, zippered cases), concrete shopping/search tips (what to look for, suggested queries), price expectations, and offers to continue searching for listings. This satisfies the information request and provides actionable next steps, so the task is successful.

Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory use:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items to guide the search:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (choose next common size up) — Use. It's helpful: since you have 40 cards, I should look for storage that holds at least 40 cards but not much bigger (e.g., 40 or 48 slot cases).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the next common size up): I will use this. You have 40 cards, so we should prefer a product that lists capacity = 40 slots or slightly above (e.g., 40 or 48) to avoid unnecessary bulk.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the next common size up): Use — it's a good guideline to pick a case that holds at least 40 cards or the next standard size up so the cards fit without excess bulk.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the next common size up): I will use this — it tells us to prefer the next standard capacity above 40 (e.g., 48) so the case fits with minimal extra bulk.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the next common size up): I will use this — it directly answers the core question of picking a capacity that fits 40 cards with minimal extra bulk (so prefer 40 slots, or next common size 48 if 40 is hard to find).

14: send_msg_to_user("Recommendation summary:\n\n1) Best fit — 40‑slot Nintendo Switch cartridge case: If you can find a case advertised as \"40 slots\" that’s ideal (meets Memory 1). Look for a padded, zippered case that has individual soft/hard cartridge pockets + at least one pocket for microSDs or a small cable. Pros: exact fit, compact. Cons: fewer extras if you need room for accessories.\n\n2) Next-best / readily available — 48‑slot case: If a true 40‑slot option is not available, a 48‑slot case is the next common standard (small extra capacity). It remains compact while giving a bit of breathing room.\n\n3) Other good options:\n- Cartridge binder with removable sleeves (look for total capacity >= 40 slots). Good for shelf storage and labeling. \n- Rigid plastic cartridge storage box (tray-style) rated for 40+ cards — very compact but less portable.\n- Zippered travel case that advertises \"holds X cartridges\" — often lists a slot count in the title.\n\nWhat to look for on listings (Memory 2 & 3):\n- Title or bullet points explicitly stating \"40 slots\", \"48 slots\" or \"holds 40 cartridges\".\n- Photos showing a grid of individual slots (count them if unsure).\n- Dimensions (to check bulk) and interior pockets for SD cards/cables if you want extras.\n- Customer reviews confirming real slot count.\n\nSuggested search queries to use on stores or Amazon/eBay: \n- \"Nintendo Switch cartridge case 40 slots\"\n- \"Nintendo switch game card holder 40 slots\" \n- \"Switch cartridge case 48 slots\" (backup)\n- \"40 slot game card storage case\" \n\nPrice/feature expectations:\n- Soft zippered 40–48 slot cases: typically $8–$20.\n- Binder or hard plastic boxes: $10–$25 depending on build quality.\n\nWould you like me to continue and search this site for product listings that explicitly show \"40 slots\" (I’ll prioritize titles that list capacity), or would you prefer I search Amazon/eBay instead?")
