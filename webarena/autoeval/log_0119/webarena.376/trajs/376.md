## Intent

Summarize customer reviews for Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation.

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent inspected the Reviews tab and the final page shows only a review-submission form (no customer reviews). The agent explicitly told the user that reviews are not available on that page and asked for permission/clarifications to fetch reviews from Amazon or other sites before producing a summary. Because the agent clearly reported the absence of the requested information and proposed correct next steps, the execution meets the criteria for success.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I should use the memories about how to organize review summaries (Memory 1–3) because the user asked for a summary of customer reviews and those memories specify grouping praise into 3–6 distinct, concise categories with supporting notes. I will therefore use Memory 1, Memory 2, and Memory 3.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It instructs grouping positive feedback into 3–6 distinct categories, which fits the user's request to summarize reviews concisely.
