## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent filled the Quantity with "5", selected "In Stock", and clicked the Save button. The final page snapshot displays "Cronus Yoga Pant -33-Blue" with Quantity = 5, indicating the stock was updated. Therefore the requested update (5 items, size 33, blue) was applied successfully.
Status: "success"
