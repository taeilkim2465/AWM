## Intent

Find a subreddit focused on topics related to ML, DL, NLP, and post my question, "what is the SOTA web navigation agent repo" there

## RM

Thoughts: The agent successfully located and selected a relevant subreddit (r/MachineLearning), filled the Title and Body with the requested question, and attempted to submit, but the page returned a rate-limit error ("You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.") and the post was not created. The agent informed the user and offered sensible next options, but it did not complete the posting action requested.  
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I tried to submit your question, but the page shows: 'You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.' I can't post right now. Options:\n\n1

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose a broad community for visibility) — I will use this: posting first to a broad, high-traffic ML community is appropriate to get visibility for a general SOTA question.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (post to a broad community for visibility) is relevant and I'll use it — we're posting to the MachineLearning forum which is a broad ML community.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (post broad community first) is relevant — I'll use it to prioritize a high‑visibility ML community (e.g., r/MachineLearning) and consider cross-posting later.
===============INFO - Memory 1 is relevant (advice to post first in a broad, high-visibility community). I will use it as guidance.

Options:\n\n1) Wait and try submitting to r/MachineLearning (currently selected) later — I can retry when you tell me to. \n2) Try posting to r/deeplearning (or another subreddit) now — I can switch the forum and attempt submission, but the rate limit may still block it. \n3) I can prepare the post(s) for the subreddits you choose (r/MachineLearning, r/deeplearning, etc.) and leave them ready so you can submit them when the rate limit is lifted.\n\nWhich would you like me to do? If you want option 2 or 3, tell me which subreddit(s) to target (I suggest r/MachineLearning and r/deeplearning).")
