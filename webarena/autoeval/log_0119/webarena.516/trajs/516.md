## Intent

Add this product to my wishlist

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a green confirmation banner stating "Elmwood Inn Fine Teas... has been added to your Wish List" and the My Wish List page displays "9 Item(s)" (and the top link shows My Wish List 9 items), indicating the click successfully added the product to the wishlist.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the product-page wishlist controls to add the item because the product detail page already shows an "Add to Wish List" link and the user appears signed in.
