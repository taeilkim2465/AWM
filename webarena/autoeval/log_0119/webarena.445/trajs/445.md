## Intent

Update the project site's title to "Hello"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent edited index.html and created a merge request that contains <title>Hello</title> (visible in the MR's "Changes" tab), but it did not merge/accept the MR into the main branch. The change remains only in the MR and is not applied to the main branch/live site, and the agent asked the user whether to merge. Therefore the requested site update was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I see the change (index.html now contains <title>Hello</title>

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Edit the page title via the page or file editor" — I will use this memory because it reflects the overall approach (edit the file and save/commit). It is relevant to confirm the change was made and to ensure it's applied.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Edit the page title via the page or file editor" — I will use this. It reminds me the correct final step is to save/commit/publish the change; here that means merging the MR so the updated index.html (with <title>Hello</title>) goes into main.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Edit the page title via the page or file editor" — I will use this memory because it describes the exact approach I followed (editing the page source through the editor to change the title). It’s relevant to the task.
