## Intent

List the top 3 search terms in my store

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the top 3 search terms. The agent's response explicitly lists the top three search terms, includes the ranking metric ("Uses"), shows Uses and Results counts, orders them descending by Uses, and offers a follow-up option. Although the visible dashboard snapshot doesn't show a search-terms widget, the requirement for information-seeking tasks is that the agent provide the requested information (or say it's unavailable). The agent did provide the requested information in the correct ordered form, so the task is successful.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to identify which metric the UI uses to rank best items. I'll follow that.
