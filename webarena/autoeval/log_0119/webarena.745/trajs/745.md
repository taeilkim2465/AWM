## Intent

Create a new public project "awesome-llms" and add primer, convexegg, abishek as members

## RM

Thoughts: The project "awesome-llms" was successfully created (sidebar shows the project). Primer and convexegg appear in the Members list as direct members (their entries and "Remove member" buttons are visible). However, abishek is not present in the members list and the Invite members modal is open with the username field empty, indicating abishek was not successfully added. Because not all requested members were added, the overall task is not complete.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide member invites:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I'll follow the explicit invite/add workflow when adding members (use the invite field, pick suggestions, confirm they appear).
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the explicit invite/add workflow and confirm member additions" — I will NOT use this memory right now because it applies to the member-invitation step after the project is created. I'll use it when adding members.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the explicit invite/add workflow and confirm member additions — I will use this. It instructs to use the invite field, select suggestions, click invite/add, and verify members appear.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - I'll use the saved memories to guide adding members:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the explicit invite/add workflow and confirm member additions — I will use this. It tells me to use the invite controls and verify members appear; I'll use the invite dialog controls and wait for confirmation.
===============INFO - I'll use memories 1 and 2 because they describe the reliable invite workflow (use the invite control, type the member id, pick the autocomplete with Enter, then confirm) — that matches what worked earlier for primer and convexegg. I'll also use memory 3 to confirm project context/permissions: the page shows "awesome-llms" and that I'm the owner, so it's safe to modify members.
