## Intent

Please provide me with the complete product names of Oral B brush heads designed for children, along with their corresponding price range per brush

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for complete product names of Oral‑B brush heads for children plus the price range per brush. The action history shows searches and clicks but the final page snapshot only shows a search results header and product images without visible product titles or prices (items 73–108 of 39638). There is no evidence the agent extracted or returned the requested product names and pricing, nor an explicit statement that the information is unavailable. Therefore the task requirements for an information‑seeking request were not met.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories about computing price ranges from visible listing prices because the user specifically asked for price ranges per brush and those memories advise extracting numeric prices from listings and computing min/max rather than trusting summary labels.
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories because they instruct how to compute price ranges from the visible listing prices by extracting numeric prices and normalizing them (Memory 1, Memory 2, Memory 3). All three are relevant and consistent: I'll extract numeric prices and pack counts from product titles shown on the search results and compute per-brush prices (min and max if needed).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It tells me to extract numeric prices from visible listings and compute min/max rather than trusting summary labels — that is directly relevant for computing price-per-brush ranges.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It instructs how to compute price ranges from visible listing prices (extract numeric prices and compute min/max), which I'll apply once I gather listings.
===============INFO - I will use the stored "Compute price range" memories because they are directly relevant: I need to extract numeric prices from visible listings, normalize them, and compute per-brush price values and the min/max range. Specifically:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it instructs extracting numeric prices from visible listings and computing min/max; that's exactly needed to derive per‑brush price ranges from the listings.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they remind me to extract raw numeric prices from the visible listings, normalize them, and compute min/max (and to expand results if pagination may miss extremes). Specifically:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this (yes). It tells me to extract numeric prices from visible listings and compute min/max rather than trusting labels.
