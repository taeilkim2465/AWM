{"id": 334, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked when they last ordered \"muffin cornbread mix\" (an information-seeking task about order contents). The final page is the My Orders list which shows order numbers, dates, totals and actions, but not the products in each order. The action history only navigated to the orders list and changed page size; it did not open any \"View Order\" to inspect order line items or search order contents. Because the agent never checked individual order details to find that specific product, it cannot determine when that item was last ordered. Therefore the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
