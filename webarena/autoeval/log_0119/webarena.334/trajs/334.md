## Intent

Tell me when I last ordered my muffin cornbread mix?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked when they last ordered "muffin cornbread mix" (an information-seeking task about order contents). The final page is the My Orders list which shows order numbers, dates, totals and actions, but not the products in each order. The action history only navigated to the orders list and changed page size; it did not open any "View Order" to inspect order line items or search order contents. Because the agent never checked individual order details to find that specific product, it cannot determine when that item was last ordered. Therefore the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to locate the most recent order properly:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the orders overview with filters and sorting to identify the correct "most recent" order.
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories to guide finding the last order containing "muffin cornbread mix".
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will partially use this — it advises using the orders overview with filters/sorting to find the most recent order. The page already appears sorted by date (newest first), and I can increase items per page to reduce pagination. So I'll apply that step (set "Show" to 50).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they instruct me to locate the correct order from the orders overview and open the exact order record before confirming product details. Memory 3 (use most recent completed order) is not strictly necessary yet because the user didn't limit to completed orders — they asked for the last time they ordered a specific product, so I should search orders from newest to oldest regardless of status.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they instruct me to find the item from the orders overview (apply filters/search and sort by date) and to open the exact order before confirming product details. I will not use Memory 3 now since the user didn't specify "completed" orders only, and I should check all orders first.
===============INFO - I'll check the memory items first.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they instruct me to find the correct most-recent order by using the orders overview, applying filters/search, and opening the exact order to verify the product. I will not use Memory 3 right now because the user didn't specify "completed" orders only — they asked "last ordered" which could include any status; if they meant only completed orders I'll confirm after locating results.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the orders overview with filters and sorting to identify the correct "most recent" order — I will use this memory (yes). The orders list is the right place to find the most recent order that contains the muffin cornbread mix; I should make sure all orders are visible so I can search them.
