## Intent

Increase the price of black fitness tshirts from Desiree with size XS by 37%

## RM

Thoughts: The product page clearly shows "Desiree Fitness Tee-XS-Black" and the Price field was changed to $32.88 (action clear('985') then fill('985','32.88') and final save click). A 37% increase of an original $24.00 price equals $24.00 * 1.37 = $32.88, so the agent applied the correct increased price and saved it for the correct product/variant.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm listing is a single item..." — I will use this. The product page is already open (Product name, SKU WS05-XS-Black) and shows a single-item SKU and a single Price field, so it matches the single-unit criteria.
