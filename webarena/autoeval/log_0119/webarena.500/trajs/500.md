## Intent

Update order #301 with the DHL tracking number 239028439840

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to order 000000301 and attempted to set carrier to DHL and the tracking number, but the filled tracking value contains an extra trailing "#" ("239028439840#") instead of the requested "239028439840". Because the tracking number was modified incorrectly, the requested update was not completed as specified. Therefore the task failed even though the agent reported success and reached the order page (the "Send Tracking Information" button is visible).
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'Update complete: Order #000000301 now has carrier "DHL" and tracking number "239028439840#". I verified these values on the order detail page and did not see any validation errors. Would you like me to click "Send Tracking Information" to notify the customer, or make any other changes?'
