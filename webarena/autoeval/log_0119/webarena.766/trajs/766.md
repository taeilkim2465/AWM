Find the walkway to the closest grocessory owned by Amazon from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent set the routing mode to Foot (OSRM), entered 401 Shady Ave as origin and "Whole Foods Market Pittsburgh" as destination, and clicked Go. The page displays walking directions to Whole Foods (an Amazon-owned grocery), including a route on the map, total distance (1.4 km), time (0:18) and step-by-step turns — fulfilling the user's request for the walkway. Therefore the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"
