## Intent

Post a review of my recent reading "To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee" in the r/books with my comment "good book!".

## RM

Thoughts: This was a content-modification task (post a review). The action history shows the agent filled the Title and Body and attempted to submit, but the page displays the error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The agent informed the user of the failure and offered options, but the submission was blocked and the post was not created — task not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I attempted to post your review, but the site shows: 'You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.' I filled Title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee' and Body: 'good book!' but the submission was blocked. What would you like me to do next?\n\nOptions:\n- Wait and retry later (tell me how long to wait or I can retry after a few minutes
