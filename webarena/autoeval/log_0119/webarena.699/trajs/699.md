## Intent

Draft a new marketing price rule for spring sale that offers a 20 percent discount site-wide for all customers

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the New Catalog Price Rule form with the Rule Name field empty and the Active toggle set to No, even though the action history attempted to fill the name and discount. Websites and customer groups appear selected, and a discount value was entered, but the rule was not enabled/saved (Save is still available and the form shows required fields not completed). Because required fields are not set/active and the rule was not applied, the agent did not successfully create an active site-wide 20% price rule for all customers.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (pre-calculating reduced price) because for a site-wide percentage discount we can set a 20% discount directly in the rule instead of entering individually computed prices.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Pre-calculate and format the reduced price — NOT using. This memory references a 15% reduction and computing explicit product prices; for a site-wide 20% catalog rule we don't need to precompute individual prices now.
===============INFO - I will create a new catalog price rule. To do that I need to open the "Add New Rule" form.
===============INFO - I will consider each memory item and decide whether to use it:
===============INFO - I'll not use Memory 1 because this is a percentage-based catalog rule (no per-product price pre-calculation needed).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will not use the memory items because:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Pre-calculate and format the reduced price" — NOT USING. This is for product-level price edits; we're creating a catalog price rule that applies a percentage, so no per-product price pre-calculation is needed.
===============INFO - We need to finish creating the catalog price rule: set the Rule Name (the required field) and save & apply the rule.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Pre-calculate and format the reduced price): I will NOT use this memory now. This task is creating a catalog price rule (percentage-based), not editing individual product prices, so pre-calculating per-product values is unnecessary.
