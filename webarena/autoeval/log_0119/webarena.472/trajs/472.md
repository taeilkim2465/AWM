## Intent

Cancel order 299

## RM

Thoughts: The final page for order #000000299 clearly shows "Order Status: Canceled" in the Order & Account Information section, which matches the user's intent to cancel order 299. The action history and snapshot confirm the cancellation was applied successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use the provided memories to guide the cancellation safely.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It reminds me to complete the full cancellation workflow (trigger cancellation, handle any required inputs/reason/checkboxes, confirm dialogs, and wait for success). I'll follow that after opening the cancellation dialog.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Complete and verify the cancellation workflow): USE. The modal is open and I must complete the cancellation and confirm it succeeded, so I'll follow through with the cancellation confirmation and then look for the resulting status/success message.
