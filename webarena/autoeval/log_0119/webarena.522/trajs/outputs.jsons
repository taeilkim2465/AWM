The agent only asked clarifying questions (send_msg_to_user) and performed no fork actions; the final page snapshot shows the user's Projects list, not any evidence that Facebook repos were forked. No repository fork operations or navigation to a Facebook org page are recorded. Therefore the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
