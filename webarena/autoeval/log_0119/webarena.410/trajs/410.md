## Intent

Reply to the first reply in this post with "don't panic"

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent opened the reply box, filled "don't panic" and posted it; the final page snapshot displays "don't panic" as a reply under the comment. This matches the user's intent to reply to the first reply with "don't panic."
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Reply posted successfully: don't panic"

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to ensure I post the user's exact provided text verbatim ("don't panic"). I'll use Memory 2 to remember to confirm the reply was posted after submitting. I will not use Memory 3 because theme preview instructions are irrelevant to this task.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Enter user-provided text verbatim): I will use this — the user gave an exact reply string ("don't panic") that must be posted verbatim.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Enter user-provided text verbatim): I will use this — the user requested an exact reply "don't panic" and Memory 1 tells me to post the exact string without changes.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Enter user-provided text verbatim): I will use this — the user requested an exact reply string, so I must enter "don't panic" exactly as provided.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Enter user-provided text verbatim): I will use this. The user gave an exact string ("don't panic") that must be posted verbatim if a reply form appears.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Enter user-provided text verbatim): Normally I'd use this when typing the exact reply text. I will not need to use it now because the page already shows the exact text present.
