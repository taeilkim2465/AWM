## Intent

Find the page of the longest bridge in the Western hemisphere on the map.

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted the map page for the longest bridge in the Western Hemisphere. The actions show multiple searches for "Lake Pontchartrain Causeway" then a click that appears to toggle the map bounds. The final snapshot shows the Nominatim search page with a global map and no search result marker, no place details, and no place page opened. The agent never navigated to or displayed the specific place page for the bridge, so the task was not completed.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (type a concise targeted name into the map search and choose the top result) because it fits this task: searching the map for a specific bridge name should take me directly to its place page. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because they concern measuring driving distances or airport verification, which are not relevant here.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): This suggests using a concise targeted name in the search box and selecting the top result. I'll try a shorter name because the previous search returned no results.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — I'll use the strategy to enter a concise, targeted name and pick a precise query. My previous searches ("Pontchartrain Causeway" and "Lake Pontchartrain Causeway") returned no results, so I'll make the query more specific by adding the state and country to reduce ambiguity for Nominatim.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (type a concise name and pick the top result) because it’s the most efficient search approach for finding a place page. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because those concern computing driving distances and airports and are not relevant to finding the bridge's map page.
