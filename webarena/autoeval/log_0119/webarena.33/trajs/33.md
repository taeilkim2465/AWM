## Intent

I will arrive Pittsburgh Airport soon. Provide the name of a Hilton hotel in the vicinity, if available. Then, tell me the the shortest walking distance to a supermarket from the hotel.

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot and search results show the Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport (303 Park Manor Drive) was found, but there is no supermarket result or any walking-distance measurement on the final page. The action history contains repeated supermarket searches but the final state only displays the hotel—so the agent did not provide the supermarket name or the shortest walking distance (nor explicitly state it was unavailable). Therefore the user's full information request was not satisfied.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it's about verifying airport addresses and driving distances; the user asked for a Hilton hotel near the airport and walking distance to a supermarket, so I won't use this memory now.
