Although the action history includes a fill with the MIT license text (step 7), the final page snapshot still shows the original \"DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE\" content. That means the change was not saved/committed or was not applied to LICENSE.txt. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.", "status": "failure"}}
