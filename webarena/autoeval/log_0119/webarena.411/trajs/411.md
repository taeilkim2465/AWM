## Intent

Make the LICENSE of byteblaze/cloud-to-butt to MIT license.

## RM

Thoughts: This was a content-modification task to change the repository's LICENSE to the MIT license. Although the action history includes a fill with the MIT license text (step 7), the final page snapshot still shows the original "DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE" content. That means the change was not saved/committed or was not applied to LICENSE.txt. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory checks:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (permission/attribution) is not relevant to editing a repository LICENSE, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will review the memory items first and decide whether to use them:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm permission and attribution requirements): I will NOT use this memory now — the user specifically asked to change the repository license and appears to own or control the repository; if this is not the case they should confirm, but I won't block progress on that assumption.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (permission/attribution) is not relevant to changing a repository license, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (permission/attribution) is not relevant for changing a repository LICENSE — I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (permission/attribution) is not relevant here — this is a license file change in a repo, not an image repost, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm permission and attribution): I will use this memory in the sense that I will assume you have the right to change the repository's LICENSE (you asked me directly to make it MIT). If that assumption is wrong, tell me and I will stop.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm permission and attribution) is not relevant — this task is about changing a repository LICENSE file, not reposting an image, so I will not use it.
