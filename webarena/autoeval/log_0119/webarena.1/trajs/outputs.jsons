Although the agent reported \"Sprite \u2014 7 orders,\" the final page snapshot only shows the report filter controls (Period = Month, From 1/1/22, To 3/31/22) and no results table or evidence of the report being displayed. The agent did not present or show the report results in the final state, so the claimed verification is unsupported by the page state. Therefore the task is not successfully completed.", "status": "failure"}}
