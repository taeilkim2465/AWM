## Intent

How much I spent on hair care and hair style shopping during Jan 2023

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the My Orders list but no orders from January 2023 are visible and there is no indication the agent filtered by date or product category (hair care / hair style) or summed relevant item totals. The user asked for the amount spent on hair-related shopping in Jan 2023; the agent did not provide that total nor an explicit statement that the information is unavailable. Therefore the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"
