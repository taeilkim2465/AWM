## Intent

Subscribe to the newsletter of OneStopMarket

## RM

Thoughts: The agent located the newsletter signup and asked the user which email to use, but it did not fill the form or click "Subscribe" and there is no evidence the subscription was completed or a confirmation shown in the final page snapshot. Because the required action (submitting the newsletter signup) was not performed, the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I found the newsletter signup in the footer ("Sign Up for Our Newsletter:" + a textbox and a "Subscribe" button

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Always verify order status before sending notifications): Not relevant for subscribing to a newsletter, so I will not use it.
