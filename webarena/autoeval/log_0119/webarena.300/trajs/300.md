## Intent

Show the most recent pending order

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows Order #000000189 with the label "Pending", the order date (May 2, 2023), and the item/subtotal details. This matches the user's request to show the most recent pending order, so the agent successfully navigated to and displayed the pending order details.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 because it instructs to apply the status filter and sort by purchase date (newest first) before selecting an order — that's directly relevant for finding the most recent pending order. I will not use Memory 1 or Memory 3 because both focus on completed orders, and the user asked specifically for a pending order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It specifically says to select the most recent completed orders; the user asked for the most recent pending order, so this memory would be misleading.
