## Intent

What is the color configuration of the picture frame I bought Sep 2022

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to an order dated September 29, 2022 and the page shows an item with "Color: Pink Teddy" (a velvet loveseat sofa). The screenshot does not show a picture frame or any color for a picture frame, and there's no evidence the agent extracted or reported the picture-frame color. Because the requested information (the picture frame's color configuration) is not present or returned, the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories before proceeding:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (map statuses): I will not use this now — mapping the "fulfilled" status isn't needed to find the frame's color configuration.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3, and not use Memory 1.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (status label mapping): Not needed right now — I'm not tallying orders or mapping "fulfilled" to a local label for this request.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (map statuses): I will not use this now — the user asked about an item's color, not order status mapping.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Map abstract statuses to platform's status labels" — I will not use this right now because I'm first trying to locate the Sep 2022 order; status mapping is only needed later if we must interpret "fulfilled" vs "complete/shipped."
===============INFO - Memory 1 (map statuses): I will NOT use this — mapping order-status labels isn't needed to find the product configuration.
