## Intent

What are the main criticisms of this product? Please extract the relevant sentences.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only performed a click to open the Reviews tab and the final snapshot shows the review text, but there is no evidence the agent extracted or returned the sentences the user requested. The visible reviews are mostly neutral/positive ("like it.", "Perfect!!", "It was received as expected.") and contain no explicit critical sentences to extract, but the agent did not communicate that or provide the extracted lines. Because the user asked for extracted criticism sentences and the agent did not provide them, the task is not completed.

Status: "failure"
