## Intent

I am doing a market survey for one stop market, show me the most expensive product from Household Supplies category

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent selected the Price sort and then opened a product. The final page is a product detail (Lynx Battery 12V 200Ah...) showing a price of $900, indicating the agent opened the top-priced item after sorting. That satisfies the user's request to show the most expensive product in the household/household-supplies area. 
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide the search:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. After filtering to Household Supplies I will sort by price descending to surface the highest-priced items quickly.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use price-descending sort): YES — sorting by Price descending is the fastest way to surface the most expensive item in this category.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use price-descending sort — I will use this (yes). Sorting by price descending is the fastest way to surface the single most expensive product.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use price-descending sort — I will use this (the page is already sorted by Price and shows the highest-priced items first).
