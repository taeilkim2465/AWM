## Intent

Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got the most stars?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent replied with two repo names, but the page snapshot only shows The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com with 21 stars; there is no evidence on the provided page of "Primer / design" or a second 21-star contributed repo. The agent did not perform any further navigation or show sorting/filtering to verify the top contributed repos, so its answer is not supported by the action history or final page state.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "The top repositories (by stars

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Match contributor identity exactly..." — I will use this memory to remind myself to rely on the displayed project role (Owner/Maintainer/Developer) rather than ambiguous name matches when deciding whether you contributed. So: use.
