## Intent

I will arrive Pittsburgh Airport soon. Provide the name of a Hyatt hotel in the vicinity, if available. Then, tell me the the minimal driving time to a supermarket from the hotel.

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows the origin set to "Hyatt Regency Pittsburgh International" (so the hotel name is available), but the directions are to a supermarket far away (Distance: 665 km, Time: 8:04) with the destination pin in the New York area. The agent did not locate a nearby supermarket in Findlay Township/Pittsburgh and therefore did not provide the minimal driving time from the hotel to a local supermarket. The result is incorrect for the user's request.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (use walking mode for pedestrian distances): I will not use this — the user asked for minimal driving time to a supermarket, so walking-mode guidance isn't needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use walking-mode mapping) — I will NOT use this. The user asked for minimal driving time, so walking-mode guidance is not needed.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 and Memory 3 because they recommend getting the hotel's exact address/coordinates first before searching for nearby amenities — that's exactly the next needed step. I will not use Memory 1 because it focuses on walking-mode routing; the user asked for minimal driving time to a supermarket, so walking-mode guidance isn't relevant now.
===============INFO - I'll decide which memory items to use:
===============INFO - I'll consult the stored memories first:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode): I will not use this memory because the user asked for minimal driving time to a supermarket (driving, not walking). So memory 1 is not applicable now.
