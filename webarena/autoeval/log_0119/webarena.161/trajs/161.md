## Intent

I have a lot of Nintendo Switch game cards now, help me find the best storage option to fit all 23 cards

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for a 24‑slot Switch game card case and navigated to the product page titled "HEIYING Game Card Case... with 24 Game Card Slots". The page explicitly states it holds up to 24 game cards, which is sufficient for the user's 23 cards, so the agent found an appropriate storage option. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the page search to look for Nintendo Switch game card storage that explicitly lists slot capacity so we can verify it fits 23 cards.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. The first result already shows "24 Game Card Slots" in its title, which directly confirms capacity and matches your need to store 23 cards.
