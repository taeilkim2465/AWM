## Intent

Find the customer name and email with phone number 2137418080

## RM

Thoughts: The page snapshot shows the selected row for "Jennifer White" with the email "jennifer.white@yahoo.com" and phone "2137418080", which matches the agent's message. The agent located and reported the requested customer name, email, and phone number, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I found a matching customer:\n- Name: Jennifer White\n- Email: jennifer.white@yahoo.com\n- Phone: 2137418080\nWould you like me to open the full customer record, copy the email/phone to clipboard, or do anything else with this record?"
