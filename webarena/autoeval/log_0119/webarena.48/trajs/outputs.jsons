{"id": 48, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent set the page to show 50 orders, inspected the orders list (37 items shown) and looked for orders dated 6/9/2023\u20136/11/2023 (the three-day window before 6/12/2023). The visible orders in the snapshot are all from earlier months (May/Mar/Feb), and the agent treated \"Complete\" as fulfilled \u2014 reasonable for this UI. Because no orders fall within 6/9\u20136/11, the answer of 0 fulfilled orders and $0.00 spent is correct.", "status": "success"}}
