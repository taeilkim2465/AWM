## Intent

What are the main criticisms of this product? Please extract the relevant sentences.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the main criticisms and to extract the relevant sentences. The agent clicked into Reviews and extracted the two negative review sentences visible in the snapshot ("Those labial never came to me..." by Mary Mir and "DryUneven color" by catherine brown), provided reviewer/date/source and labeled the criticisms as explicit. This matches the webpage snapshot and satisfies the information-seeking task (also offered sensible next steps), so the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Here are the review sentences that contain criticisms, presented as reviewer / date / source followed by the exact quoted sentence and whether the criticism is explicit or implied:\n\n1

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to format the extraction (present reviewer metadata plus the exact quoted sentences and note explicit vs implied). I will not use Memory 3 now because the user already specified the task scope (extract main criticisms) and did not ask to limit number of reviews or time range—if they want limits I will ask after showing initial results.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to apply the structured extraction template (reviewer name/date/source + exact quoted sentences). I'll use Memory 2 to include a short checklist note (explicit vs implied) and to offer to expand the search after presenting initial results. I will not use Memory 3 right now because the user already asked for the relevant sentences and didn't ask to change scope; I can ask about scope after showing the extraction.

Color is gorgeous, texture is perfect.
