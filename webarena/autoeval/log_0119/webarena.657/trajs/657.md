## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to fill the Contact Us form with a refund request that states the speaker broke after three days and to include Order #148 and the product SKU, without submitting. The action history shows the agent attempted to fill the full message and asked the user for the SKU (leaving a placeholder). However, the final page snapshot shows the message field only contains a short signature ("Thank you, Emma Lopez emma.lopez@gmail.com") — the required complaint text is not present, and the SKU remains as a placeholder in the agent's draft. Because the final form does not contain the requested complaint text nor a real SKU, the task was not completed as requested.
