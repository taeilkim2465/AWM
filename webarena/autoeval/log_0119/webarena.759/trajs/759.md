Action History:
1: send_msg_to_user("I don't know which city Sophia Young lives in. Would you please tell me the city (or full address) to use as the origin, or would you like me to try to look it up? Once I have the origin I will run the OpenStreetMap directions tool to show the route and estimated driving time to New York City and report the distance and caveats.")
