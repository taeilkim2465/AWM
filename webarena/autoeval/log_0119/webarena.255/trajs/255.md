Who is the operator of PIT airport

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the operator of Pittsburgh International Airport. The agent's actions show repeated searches on the Nominatim search page, but the final screenshot only shows the search UI and a world map with no search results or any page content showing an operator or related details. There is no evidence the agent retrieved or reported the requested operator information (nor an explicit statement that the information is unavailable). Therefore the task did not complete successfully.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll follow the required memory-check step first.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (prefer live authoritative sources) because the operator of an airport can change and I should verify from authoritative pages (airport/FAA). I will use Memory 3 (present results with next steps) to include the source and offer follow-ups after I find the operator. I will not use Memory 2 (nearest POI routing) because it's not relevant to asking who operates PIT.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer live authoritative sources over cached memories): I will use this—it's a useful guideline. I should fetch the operator from an authoritative/current source rather than relying only on past memory.
===============INFO - Memory review:
