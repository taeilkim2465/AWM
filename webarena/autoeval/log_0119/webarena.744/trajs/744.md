## Intent

Create a new public project "AutoAGI" and add primer as members

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows the project "AutoAGI" in the sidebar and a success banner "Members were successfully added". The Members list includes Primer (@primer) as a direct member (role Guest) alongside the owner, so the project was created and the user "primer" was added. This satisfies the user's intent to create the project and add the member.
Status: "success"
