## Intent

Draft a refund message via their "contact us" form for the phone case I bought March 2023. It broke after three days of use. The shop requires the order id, the reason and the amount to refund in the message. Don't submit yet

## RM

Thoughts: The drafted message in the action history meets the user's requirements: it includes an Order ID placeholder, the stated reason (phone case broke after three days), a requested refund amount placeholder, and asks about including shipping/taxes, photos, returns, and next steps. It also includes contact/signature placeholders and was not submitted. Therefore the agent fulfilled the drafting task without submitting it.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Order ID: [ENTER ORDER ID]\nReason: Phone case broke after three days of normal use\nRequested refund amount: $[ENTER AMOUNT] (please confirm whether this should include shipping/taxes

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they all emphasize the same required formatting: put the order identifier, a concise reason, and the requested refund amount at the very top of the contact message. Using them ensures the drafted message meets the shop's stated requirements and speeds processing.
