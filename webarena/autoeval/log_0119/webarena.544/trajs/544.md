## Intent

Update the description of Selena Yoga Hoodie to highlight the real user positive reviews by quoting the comments

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent cleared and filled the product title and then filled the description field (id 4099) with HTML that adds a "What customers are saying" section containing three quoted reviews. The agent then saved the product (clicked/pressed Enter on the Save button). The final page displays the confirmation banner "You saved the product." which indicates the updated description was successfully saved. This matches the user's intent to update the description to highlight real user positive reviews by quoting the comments.
Status: "success"
