{"id": 384, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent's reply lists multiple customer names alleged to complain about quality/durability/material issues, but the final webpage snapshot only clearly shows one reviewer (Lisa Lee) explicitly complaining the ring broke. The visible reviews for MH and Diana Alcaraz do not clearly match the agent's listed names or the specified issue (MH praises colors with minor imperfections; Diana complains about color mismatch, not material/durability). The other names the agent returned (Evelyn Kurver; Amanda; N Randall; Misba009; Amazon Customer) are not visible in the provided snapshot and the action history does not show extracted text proving those names complain about quality. Because the agent's answer includes unsupported claims and omits verification from the final page, the task is not successfully completed.", "status": "failure"}}
