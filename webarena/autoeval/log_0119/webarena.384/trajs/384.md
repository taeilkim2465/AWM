## Intent

List the customer names who complain about the quality of EYZUTAK phone cases

## RM

Thoughts: The agent's reply lists multiple customer names alleged to complain about quality/durability/material issues, but the final webpage snapshot only clearly shows one reviewer (Lisa Lee) explicitly complaining the ring broke. The visible reviews for MH and Diana Alcaraz do not clearly match the agent's listed names or the specified issue (MH praises colors with minor imperfections; Diana complains about color mismatch, not material/durability). The other names the agent returned (Evelyn Kurver; Amanda; N Randall; Misba009; Amazon Customer) are not visible in the provided snapshot and the action history does not show extracted text proving those names complain about quality. Because the agent's answer includes unsupported claims and omits verification from the final page, the task is not successfully completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Customers who complain about quality/durability/material issues: Lisa Lee; Evelyn Kurver; Amanda; N Randall; Misba009; Amazon Customer."

===============INFO - I will search the site for the EYZUTAK phone case so I can find reviews/complaints and extract customer names.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Organize complaints into distinct, non-overlapping categories" — I won't use this right now; it's useful later when summarizing complaints but not for navigating to the product page.
===============INFO - I'll check the memory items first and decide which to use:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (organize complaints into categories): Not needed for this step — the user only asked for the customer names who complain about quality, not to categorize complaints. I will not use it.
===============INFO - I'll check the stored memories to decide which to use before proceeding.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Organize complaints into categories): I will not use this now — the user only asked for the customer names who complain about quality; categorization is extra work for later.
