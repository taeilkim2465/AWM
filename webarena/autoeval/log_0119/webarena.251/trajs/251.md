## Intent

Tell me the coordinates of bus stop on the Carnegie art museum side of the street near CMU in DD format

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for DD coordinates of the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum of Art side of Forbes Ave near CMU. The agent opened the map Share panel and extracted the Geo URI shown in the page (geo:40.44430,-79.94922?z=19). The reply gave the latitude and longitude in DD (40.44430, -79.94922) and cited the Geo URI as source, which matches the visible page state. This satisfies the information-seeking task.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Coordinates (DD

===============INFO - I will use the map's search to locate the Carnegie Museum of Art area in Pittsburgh, then use the map's share/permalink feature to extract the exact decimal-degree (DD) coordinates for the bus stop on the Carnegie Museum side of the street near CMU.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because the map application's Share/Geo URI features are the most reliable way to extract decimal-degree (DD) coordinates once I have the correct map marker or object selected. I will not use Memory 3 because pedestrian routing/origin details are not needed to just extract a bus stop's coordinates.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2: they recommend using the map application's Share/Permalink or Geo URI to extract precise DD coordinates, which is the most reliable approach once I have the map centered on the exact bus stop. I will not use Memory 3 because pedestrian routing is unnecessary for simply obtaining coordinates.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they recommend using the map application's "Share" / permalink / Geo URI feature to extract precise decimal-degree (DD) coordinates directly from the link — this is the most reliable method here. I will NOT use Memory 3 because pedestrian routing is not needed; the user only asked for coordinates of the bus stop.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use map share/Geo URI tools to get DD coordinates — I will use this (yes). It directly applies: the OpenStreetMap Share panel exposes a Geo URI with decimal-degree coords.
