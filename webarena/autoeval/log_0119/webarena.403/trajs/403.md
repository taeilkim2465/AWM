## Intent

Change my reddit bio to "Awesome Prompt Artist"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent cleared and filled the biography field with "Awesome Prompt Artist" and clicked Save. The page shows the biography textbox and preview containing that text, the sidebar displays "Awesome Prompt Artist", and a green confirmation toast says "The biography was updated." These confirm the change succeeded.
Status: "success"
