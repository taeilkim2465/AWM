## Intent

Gather the titles of Nintendo Switch Fortnite Wildcat Console EU reviews with 3 stars and less rating from OneStopShop, and post them in the games subreddit under the title "real user feedback on Nintendo Switch Fortnite Wildcat Console EU"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the product's reviews page and revealed at least one qualifying review ("Code not available!!" — 1 star), but there is no evidence it collected all review titles with rating ≤3 (pagination indicates more reviews) nor that it posted anything to the games subreddit. The user explicitly asked to gather those titles and post them; the action history contains only in-site navigation clicks and no external posting. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — helpful if star ratings are not shown on the review page; I'll scan review titles/text for negative language to approximate 3-star-or-less reviews if explicit ratings aren't visible.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Infer dissatisfaction from review text when ratings are unavailable): I will use this. If individual review star icons or numeric ratings are missing, I'll rely on negative language in titles/excerpts to identify reviews that are 3 stars or less.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2, and not use Memory 3.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Infer dissatisfaction from review text when ratings are unavailable): I will use this — if any reviews lack explicit star info on the page I can rely on negative wording to classify them as <=3 stars.
===============INFO - Memory items — decide whether to use them now:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Infer dissatisfaction from review text when ratings are unavailable): I will NOT use this — ratings are visible on the OneStopShop reviews so we can rely on the explicit star/percentage values.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Infer dissatisfaction from review text when ratings are unavailable): I will not use this — the reviews on the page show rating percentages/stars, so we can rely on those rather than inferring from text.
