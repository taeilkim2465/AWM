## Intent

Set my gitlab status as Playing Badminton.

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent cleared and filled the status field with "Playing Badminton." and clicked to save. The final page snapshot (user menu) displays "Playing Badminton." under the account, matching the requested status. The agent's confirmation message correctly reports the change. Therefore the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Done — your GitLab status is set to: “Playing Badminton.” I can change the emoji or expiration if you want; should I?"

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll not use the stored memory items because they relate to SSH checks, repository health checks, and license-change follow-ups — none are relevant to changing the GitLab user status.
===============INFO - I'll consider each memory item and decide whether to use it:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it's about SSH checks for cloning; I will not use it for setting a status.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it's about SSH checks when cloning repos. I will NOT use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (SSH checks): Not relevant to setting a GitLab status — do not use.
