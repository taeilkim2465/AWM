## Intent

What is the duration required to first walk from Carnegie Mellon University to apple store shadyside, and then drive to starbucks on craig street?

## RM

Thoughts: The final page only shows the walking directions from Carnegie Mellon University to Apple Store (Distance 1.5 km, Time: 0:03). The route/time for the second leg (drive from Apple Store to Starbucks on Craig Street) is not shown in the snapshot, and the action history ends on a Foot (OSRM) query — the agent did not present the driving duration for the second leg. Because the user asked for both durations and the driving leg is missing, the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this memory (relevant).
===============INFO - I'll use the mapping-related memories because they recommend using walking-mode routing and the site routing tool to get realistic durations and distances.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide my steps:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode — YES. I'll rely on the map directions already shown for the walking leg (CMU -> Apple Store) and confirm that result for the first leg.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this (relevant) to get an accurate walking duration from Carnegie Mellon University to the Apple Store in Shadyside.
===============INFO - I'll use the page's routing tool to get the two segment times.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this memory (already used to get the walking route from Carnegie Mellon to the Apple Store).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode — I will use this (yes) because the user asked for an actual walking duration from Carnegie Mellon University to the Apple Store.
