## Intent

Pull up the description page of the Costco in Pittsburhg near a river on Map

## RM

Thoughts: The search results pane shows two Costco entries including the Waterfront Drive West location (the one near the river), but no place description/details page is open — the results list is still displayed and the agent did not select the Waterfront result to show its description. Therefore the requested description page was not pulled up.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll search the OpenStreetMap page for Costco locations in Pittsburgh so I can open the description page for the one located near a river.
