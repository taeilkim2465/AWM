## Intent

Post a review of my recent reading "Gone with the wind" in the r/books with my comment "It's a book with history".

## RM

Thoughts: This was a content-modification task (posting). The agent correctly filled the Title, Body, and selected r/books, then attempted to submit but the page displays the error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The post was not submitted/published — the final page shows the filled form and the error message. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.  
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I can’t submit the post right now — the site shows: “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.” The form is filled (Title: 'Gone with the Wind', Body: \"It's a book with history\", Forum: r/books
