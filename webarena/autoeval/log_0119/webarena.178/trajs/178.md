## Intent

Open my latest created issue that has better in its title to check if it is closed

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for "better", opened the issue titled "Better initial load experience" (shown in the snapshot) and correctly reported its status as "Open" (green "Open" badge visible). That satisfies the user's intent to open the latest-created issue matching "better" and check whether it is closed. The required information (issue found and status) is present and correct.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I found and opened the issue titled ‘Better initial load experience’ (byteblaze/empathy-prompts#8

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3, and not use Memory 1.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find the most recent open item via the overview list): I will not use this — it filters to "Open" and sorts by creation date, but the user asked for the latest created issue that has "better" in its title (which may be closed), so restricting to Open would be wrong.
===============INFO - I will consider the three memory items first:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It recommends finding the most recent open item via the overview list and Open status filter; I already performed a title search instead, so this memory isn't needed now.
