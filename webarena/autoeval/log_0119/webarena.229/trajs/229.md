## Intent

What is the price range for products from ugreen?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the price range for UGREEN products. The agent searched and extracted prices from the 12 visible listings, computed the min/max ($6.99 to $24.99), listed the extracted prices, and noted there are 21 total items and offered to check page 2. The response provides the requested information and clearly states the scope/limits (visible items only) and offers to continue — so it satisfies the information-seeking task requirements.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Based on the 12 UGREEN listings visible on this page, the price range is $6.99 to $24.99.\n\nExtracted prices: $24.99, $7.49, $7.99, $6.99, $6.99, $9.99, $7.99, $7.99, $14.99, $12.74, $13.99, $16.99.\n\nNote: There are 21 total items (items 1–12 shown

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it instructs to extract and normalize numeric prices from listings and compute min/max; I'll follow that after finding UGREEN listings.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items because they instruct to compute the price range from the raw numeric prices visible on the listings rather than trusting summary labels.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I'll use this — it reminds me to extract and normalize numeric prices from individual listings rather than trusting summary labels.
===============INFO - I will use the memories about computing price ranges from visible listings (Memory 1, Memory 2, Memory 3) — they all apply because the best approach is to extract numeric prices from the shown product listings and compute the min and max. I will parse the 12 visible listings on this search results page (page 1) and compute the numeric range. If needed, I can check page 2 to make sure there are no lower or higher prices among the remaining items.
