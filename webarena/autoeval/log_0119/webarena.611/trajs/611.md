## Intent

Post a review of my recent reading "Harry Potter" in the r/books with my comment "Wonderful journey".

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the Title ("Harry Potter") and Body ("Wonderful journey") and attempted to submit, but the final page clearly shows the red error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." indicating a rate limit/temporary restriction prevented creation of the post. Because the submission was not accepted, the task (posting the review) was not completed successfully. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I filled the submission for r/books (Title: \"Harry Potter\", Body: \"Wonderful journey\"

===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about highlighting reviews in product pages, not relevant to posting this submission.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Highlight reviews block): Not relevant — that's about showing review quotes on a product page, not posting to a forum. I will not use it.

Wait a while before trying again.” That means a rate limit or temporary restriction is blocking submission, so I can’t create the post right now.\n\nWhat would you like me to do next? Options:\n1) Retry posting now (I can try clicking Create submission again). \n2) Wait and retry in a few minutes (tell me how long to wait or I can poll). \n3) Save the draft locally (I can copy the title/body for you). \n4) Try a different subreddit or account. \n5) Check account/subreddit rules or your notifications for restrictions.\n\nTell me which option you prefer.")
