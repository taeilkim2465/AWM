## Intent

What's the total number of items sold in the most recent 5 orders?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent extracted the item counts for the five most recent orders (5, 4, 3, 4, 2), summed them correctly to 18, and returned the requested total along with follow-up options. The dashboard screenshot shows the first two entries consistent with the agent's list, and the agent provided the requested information rather than an error or omission.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "The dashboard 'Last Orders' shows these most recent 5 orders:\n- Sarah Miller: 5 items\n- Grace Nguyen: 4 items\n- Matt Baker: 3 items\n- Lily Potter: 4 items\n- Ava Brown: 2 items\nTotal items sold across these 5 most recent orders = 18.\n\nWould you like me to open any of the order detail pages, or go to Sales > Orders to verify/export these?"

===============INFO - I'll use the dashboard "Last Orders" table visible on the page since it lists the five most recent orders and shows the "Items" count for each.
