{"id": 762, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent used the site's routing tool (Car/OSRM) with start \"Carnegie Hall, New York, NY\" and destination \"Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA\", and the page snapshot shows the Directions panel with Distance 625 km and Time 7:22 plus route steps (Lincoln Tunnel \u2192 Turnpike \u2192 I\u2011376 \u2192 Forbes Ave). The user requested driving directions and the agent returned the distance, estimated time, and main route highlights (and offered follow-ups). Although the user said \"Carnegie Music Hall in NYC\" (the agent used \"Carnegie Hall\" in NYC), the agent noted the start and offered to adjust if a different specific start point is needed. This satisfies the information-seeking task.", "status": "success"}}
