## Intent

Get directions from Carnegie Music Hall in NYC to Carnegie Mellon University using driving options.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent used the site's routing tool (Car/OSRM) with start "Carnegie Hall, New York, NY" and destination "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA", and the page snapshot shows the Directions panel with Distance 625 km and Time 7:22 plus route steps (Lincoln Tunnel → Turnpike → I‑376 → Forbes Ave). The user requested driving directions and the agent returned the distance, estimated time, and main route highlights (and offered follow-ups). Although the user said "Carnegie Music Hall in NYC" (the agent used "Carnegie Hall" in NYC), the agent noted the start and offered to adjust if a different specific start point is needed. This satisfies the information-seeking task. 
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the page's routing/directions tool to get driving directions (Memory 1 and Memory 3). Memory 1: use the map routing tool with clear origin/destination — I will open the directions panel and then fill origin as "Carnegie Music Hall, New York, NY" and destination as "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA". I will also keep Memory 2 in mind (give estimated time/distance with caveats) — after the route is computed I will report the driving distance/time and note variability (traffic, exact endpoints, route choice).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the map routing tool to get distance and driving-time estimates — I will use this (relevant).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — the page's routing tool is exactly what we should use to get distance and driving-time estimates.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the map routing tool): YES — the page already has a routing result so I'll rely on it.
