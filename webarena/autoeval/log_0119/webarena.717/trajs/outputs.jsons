The action log shows many clicks but no explicit vote actions are confirmed, and the final page snapshot still shows the high-score posts (3356, 3222, etc.) with no visible signs that four top posts were downvoted. Also the visible top items at the top of the list are low/negative scores, so the agent did not clearly identify and downvote the true top-four (highest-scoring) posts. There is no evidence in the history or final state that the requested four downvotes were completed.", "status": "failure"}}
