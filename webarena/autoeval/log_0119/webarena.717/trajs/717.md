## Intent

Thumbs down the top 4 post ever in movies.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to downvote (thumbs down) the top 4 posts ever in /f/movies. The action log shows many clicks but no explicit vote actions are confirmed, and the final page snapshot still shows the high-score posts (3356, 3222, etc.) with no visible signs that four top posts were downvoted. Also the visible top items at the top of the list are low/negative scores, so the agent did not clearly identify and downvote the true top-four (highest-scoring) posts. There is no evidence in the history or final state that the requested four downvotes were completed.  
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It tells me to confirm and lock the exact "top N" list before opening posts so I don't downvote the wrong items.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 but not Memory 3.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it — I should capture and verify the exact top-4 items before downvoting to avoid acting on the wrong posts.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm and lock the "top N" list): I will use this. I need to ensure I'm operating on the true "top" (all-time) list before downvoting the top 4 posts.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. I need to capture and lock the exact top-4 list before opening posts so I don't lose track or open the wrong items.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. I should confirm and lock the exact top-4 list before opening or interacting with posts to avoid acting on the wrong items.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it. It tells me to confirm and lock the top-N list before opening posts — I just verified the page is sorted "Top / All time" and the visible top 4 posts (positions 1–4) are the ones to downvote.
