## Intent

Show me the way from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of Yankees in the 80th

## RM

Thoughts: The agent entered Carnegie Mellon origin (5000 Forbes Ave / Warner Hall) and Yankee Stadium destination, generated a driving route shown on the page (Directions panel shows Distance: 637 km, Time: 7:25) and returned a summary plus the first turn-by-turn steps and follow-up options. This satisfies the user's request to "show me the way" (directions were found and reported). No errors or missing required actions are evident. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I used Warner Hall (5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1: yes — the user gave "Carnegie Mellon University" but not a precise address, so I should adopt a specific, authoritative origin (I'll use the university's main campus address and tell the user that assumption).
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to pick a precise origin address for Carnegie Mellon University (the main campus) so the route is unambiguous. I'll also use Memory 2: after plotting the route I'll report estimated distance/time with caveats and offer to fetch alternate routing or a different origin if desired. I will not use Memory 3 because the user gave a specific institution (Carnegie Mellon), not just a town name.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The page already has a specific origin filled ("Warner Hall, 5000 Forbes Avenue..." — a precise CMU campus address). I'll adopt that as the confirmed origin and state that to the user after I show the route.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a specific, confirmed origin point when computing driving distances.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a specific, confirmed origin point when computing driving distances — I will use this. The user said "Carnegie Mellon University" but didn't give a precise entrance; I'll assume the main campus address (5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213) and tell the user so so they can correct it if needed.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2, and not Memory 3.
