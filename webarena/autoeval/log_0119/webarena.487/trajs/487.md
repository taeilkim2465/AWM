## Intent

Change the page title of "Enable Cookies" page on my site to "Cookie monster coming to your place".

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the title field was filled and the page saved. The final page snapshot displays the header "Cookie monster coming to your place", the Page Title field contains that text, and a "You saved the page." confirmation is visible. This confirms the title was changed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it directly describes the correct procedure: locate the page in the admin pages list, open its edit form, change the Title field, and save. Memory 2 is not needed for this simple title change (it’s about populating slugs and descriptions). Memory 3 is somewhat useful as a reminder to use clear navigation rather than random clicks, so I'll follow it by using the CMS (Content) area navigation.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Change a page's title by editing the title field and saving): I will use this — it describes the exact steps needed once I reach the Pages list (open edit form, update Title field, save).
===============INFO - Memory 1 is directly relevant (it describes opening the page edit screen, updating the title field, and saving). I will use Memory 1.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it directly describes the needed procedure: open the page edit screen, update the Title field, and save. Memory 2 (about slugs and descriptions) is not needed right now because the user only asked to change the displayed page title. Memory 3 (confirm page context and use clear navigation) is useful to ensure I edit the correct "Enable Cookies" page rather than navigating randomly.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it directly describes the needed steps (open page edit, update Title field, save). This matches the current screen where the Page Title field is visible.
