## Intent

Today is 6/12/2023. Tell me how many fulfilled orders I have over the past year, and the total amount of money I spent.

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task but no agent response with the requested counts/sum is provided. Although the agent opened the My Orders page and set the page to show 50 orders, the snapshot alone does not show the agent computing or reporting how many fulfilled (Complete) orders occurred in the past year nor the total spent. Because the agent did not return the requested information (or explicitly state it was unavailable), the task is unsuccessful.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Provide concise summary + next steps): I will use this—after I compute the count and total I'll return a brief summary and offer follow-ups (e.g., show included orders, change status mapping, expand date range, or export).
