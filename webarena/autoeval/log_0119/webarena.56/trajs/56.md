## Intent

How long does it take to walk from Carnegie Museum of Art to a library at CMU?

## RM

Thoughts: The user requested walking time between Carnegie Museum of Art and a CMU library (Hunt Library). This is an information-seeking task, so the agent needed to return the travel time or explicitly say it couldn't be found. The action history shows attempts to fill the From/To and select "Foot (OSRM)" and many clicks, but the final page snapshot shows the From/To fields empty and a world map with no route or directions panel/results visible. No travel time or explicit "not available" message is shown. Therefore the agent did not provide the requested information.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide my approach.
===============INFO - I'll use the mapping directions tool and switch it to walking mode, per Memory 1 (use walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances). I'll also keep Memory 2 and Memory 3 in mind so I report both distance and estimated time with caveats after the route is computed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. This is a mapping/directions task and Memory 1 recommends computing a walking route from the exact locations using a map service; the OpenStreetMap directions form is already filled for walking.
===============INFO - I'll use the mapping/directions memory items because they apply: (1) use a mapping/directions tool in walking mode to get an accurate pedestrian route, and (2–3) report distance and estimated walking time with realistic caveats. The OpenStreetMap directions form is already filled for "Foot (OSRM)", but a "Welcome to OpenStreetMap" panel is covering part of the map and may be preventing the route from being shown. I'll close that welcome panel and then run the directions ("Go") so I can read the routed distance and estimated walking time to report back with caveats.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this memory (yes). We already filled the origin and destination and selected Foot (OSRM), so I should run the directions query.
===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories:
===============INFO - I will use my memories to guide the next action:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — this task needs a walking route from the Carnegie Museum of Art to a CMU library, so I should use the mapping/directions tool in walking mode.
===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide this final step:
