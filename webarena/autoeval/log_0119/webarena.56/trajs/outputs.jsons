{"id": 56, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user requested walking time between Carnegie Museum of Art and a CMU library (Hunt Library). This is an information-seeking task, so the agent needed to return the travel time or explicitly say it couldn't be found. The action history shows attempts to fill the From/To and select \"Foot (OSRM)\" and many clicks, but the final page snapshot shows the From/To fields empty and a world map with no route or directions panel/results visible. No travel time or explicit \"not available\" message is shown. Therefore the agent did not provide the requested information.", "status": "failure"}}
