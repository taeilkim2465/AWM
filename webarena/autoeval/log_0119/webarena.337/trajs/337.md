## Intent

Tell me when I last ordered my bread olive?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked when they last ordered the specific item "bread olive." The final page is the My Orders list, which only shows order numbers, dates, totals and statuses — it does not show line-item details or product names. The action history does not include opening any individual "View Order" to inspect items, so there is no evidence the agent checked order contents. Because the item-level information needed to answer the question is not visible on the current page and was not retrieved, the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It tells me to start at the orders overview, filter/search for the product, sort by date desc — that's exactly the recommended approach.
===============INFO - I will use the memories because they all recommend starting from the orders overview, using search/filters, sorting newest-first, and opening the most recent matching order to confirm details.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide this search:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it instructs to start from the orders overview, filter/search and open the newest matching order. That matches what I should do.
===============INFO - Memory 1, 2, and 3 are all relevant — I will use them. They instruct to start at the orders overview, search/filter for the product name, sort newest-first, and open the top matching order to confirm details. To follow that plan I first need to navigate from this order detail page back to "My Orders" (the orders overview).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it says to start from the orders overview and open the newest matching order. I'll follow that by opening the newest order and checking its details for "bread olive".
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories because they instruct the correct approach: search the orders overview and open the newest matching order rather than assuming the currently open order is the most recent or contains the product.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories because they directly apply to finding when a specific product (bread olive) was last ordered:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to start from the orders overview and open the newest matching order. That matches what I should do.
===============INFO - Memory check:
