## Intent

set the homepage URL on my GitLab profile to a11yproject.contributor.me

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the homepage field with "https://a11yproject.contributor.me" and clicked save, and the page shows a "Profile was successfully updated" confirmation banner on the Edit Profile screen. That indicates the profile change was applied successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items to guide how to fill the homepage field:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Enter and sanitize profile URLs): I will use this. It advises removing fragments or appended comments and providing a clean valid URL. That matches best practice for the GitLab "homepage/website" field.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It advises to provide a clean, valid URL and to remove fragments/notes. That matches best practice for the profile "Website url" field.
