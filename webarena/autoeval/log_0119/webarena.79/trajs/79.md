## Intent

What is the total count of Not Approved reviews amongst all the reviews?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the "Not Approved" filter (select_option '741') and executed the search (click '626'). The page clearly shows "0 records found" and "We couldn't find any records." Therefore the reported total of 0 Not Approved reviews is correct.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Total count of Not Approved reviews: 0'

===============INFO - Memory 1 is relevant — it suggests applying a status filter on the reviews grid to get the count for a specific status when an aggregate isn't shown. I will use this memory.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (apply the status filter to get the filtered count) and Memory 2 (use the reviews grid/filter to surface matching entries). Memory 3 (vote display details) is not relevant for counting "Not Approved" reviews.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use list/grid filters to isolate a status): I will use this — the grid has a Status filter with a "Not Approved" option; applying it and running Search will show the filtered record count.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use list/grid filters to isolate a status when no total is shown — I will use this memory (applicable). The Status filter is already set to "Not Approved" in the grid, which is exactly the method described.
