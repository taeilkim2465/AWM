## Intent

Add HONGJ Hawaiian Beach Outfits Set for Mens, Summer Tropical Tree Printed Relaxed-fit Hawaii Shirts Shorts 2 Piece Suits to my wish list

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to add the specified product to their wish list. The agent navigated to the product page and then prompted the user to choose Color and Size before adding (action 4). There is no action that selected the required options or confirmed adding to the wish list, and the page snapshot still shows the color/size choices. Because the agent paused and requested input rather than completing the add-to-wish-list action, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "This product requires selecting Color and Size before adding to your wish list. Which would you like?\n\n- Color: 115- White or 116- Black\n- Size: 3X-Large, XX-Large, X-Large, Large, or Medium\n\nIf you want me to pick, I can default to 115- White and Medium and then add it to your wish list. Please confirm."

===============INFO - I will use the provided memories to guide the action:
===============INFO - Memory 1, 2 and 3 are all relevant because they remind me to verify the product page and confirm variants before adding to a wish list. I'm already on the product detail page (I can see SKU, price, and that Color and Size are required), so I will use those memories to guide the next step.
