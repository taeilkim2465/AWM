## Intent

Pull up the description page of Carnegie Music Hall on Map

## RM

Thoughts: The search results panel shows a matching entry for "Carnegie Music Hall" but only the search results are displayed — the place's full description page (the detailed place node/page) has not been opened (the result link wasn't clicked; only "More results" is visible). Therefore the agent did not actually pull up the description page requested.
Status: "failure"
