## Intent

DisLike all submissions created by RickyDontLoseThat in subreddit massachusetts

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows a search for "RickyDontLoseThat massachusetts" with "No results" and "There are no entries to display." There is no evidence any submissions were found or that any "dislike" actions were performed. Because the agent did not locate the user's target posts in r/massachusetts and thus could not apply dislikes, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"
