## Intent

What is the price range of Canon photo printer in the One Stop Market?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent performed the search for "Canon photo printer", inspected the first results page (items 1–12) and reported a price range ($2.56–$649.99) while explicitly noting the scope and offering to scan more results. The user's request was for the price range on the One Stop Market; the agent provided that information and a clear caveat about using only the visible first-page items, so the task is satisfied as an initial answer. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Based on the 12 items visible on the first results page (excluding clearly non-printer accessories

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they recommend extracting the actual numeric prices from the displayed product listings (compute min/max from visible item prices) rather than trusting summary labels. I will NOT use Memory 3 right now (page-size/pagination advice) but I may use it later if results span multiple pages and I need to scan more items.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compute price range from displayed prices): I will use this — it tells me to parse visible product prices and compute min/max rather than trusting filters.
