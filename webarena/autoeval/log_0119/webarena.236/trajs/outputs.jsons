{"id": 236, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the nearest pharmacy within a 20-minute walk from Carnegie Mellon. The agent only asked a clarification about pharmacy-chain preference and whether to restrict results to walking routes \u226420 minutes; it did not return any pharmacy recommendations or confirm any walking times. The page snapshot even shows an incorrect long-distance route (679 km to New York), so the agent\u2019s routing/search result is wrong and no validated 20-minute walking options were provided. Because the requested information was not given (and the current route is clearly incorrect), the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
