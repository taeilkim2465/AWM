Thoughts: The action log shows the agent filled the rule name, selected all customer groups, chose "Fixed amount discount for whole cart" and entered 15, set Main Website, saved the rule and the page shows the confirmation banner "You saved the rule." The saved-rule summary the agent sent matches the requested $15 off automatic checkout for all customers, so the modification was completed successfully. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Done — I created the cart price rule. Summary of the rule I saved:\n\n- Rule name: Mother\\'s Day Sale - $15 off checkout\n- Status: Active (You saved the rule.

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Include and confirm core rule fields) because it reminds me to prepare all required fields for a complete price rule (name, description, active state, websites, customer groups, coupon behavior, usage limits, date range, priority, discount type and amount, discard subsequent rules, and conditions). This will guide the draft after opening the new-rule form.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (include core rule fields) is useful — I will use it to make sure I fill the essential fields (rule name, description, active, websites, customer groups, coupon behavior, discount type and amount). Memory 2 (pre-calc percent discount) is not relevant — this is a fixed $15 discount, not a percentage. Memory 3 (percentage-based action) is not relevant for the same reason.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Include core fields): I will use this — it reminds me to fill the main rule fields (name/description, active, websites, customer groups, coupon behavior, usage limits, date range, priority, discount action & amount). That guides which fields to set next.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Include core fields): USE — I will rely on this to confirm core fields are complete; websites and customer groups were set earlier, so now I need to ensure the discount type and amount match the requested $15 off whole cart.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Include and confirm core rule fields) to verify which required fields are set and which are missing — this helps ensure the rule is complete. I will NOT use Memory 2 (pre-calculate a percentage discount) because this promotion is a fixed $15 discount, not a percentage. I will NOT use Memory 3 (percentage-specific instructions) because we are applying a fixed amount discount.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it reminds me to include all core rule fields so the draft is complete (rule name, description, active state, websites, customer groups, coupon behavior, usage limits, date range, priority, discount type/amount, discard subsequent rules, conditions). The form already has most fields set, but Rule Name is still required and must be filled before saving.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Include and confirm core rule fields when drafting a cart discount — USE. I will report the core fields so you can confirm everything is correct.
