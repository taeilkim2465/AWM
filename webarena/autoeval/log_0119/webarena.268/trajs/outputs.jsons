{"id": 268, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the closest national park to Vinalhaven, ME and estimated bike time. The agent only performed a location search and then asked a clarifying question about whether the user meant a formally designated \"National Park\" or any national protected area and what level of timing detail they wanted. It did not provide the requested information (or state it was unavailable). For an information-seeking task the agent needed to return the answer or explicitly say it couldn't, so this is incomplete.", "status": "failure"}}
