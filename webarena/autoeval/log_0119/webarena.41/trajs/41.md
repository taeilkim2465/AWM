## Intent

List the top 1 search terms in my store

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the top 1 search term. The agent's message explicitly lists the top search term ("hollister"), the metric used (Uses), the Uses count (19), notes there is no tie, and gives total Uses for displayed rows (27) and follow-up options. This fulfills the information-seeking request.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Top 1 search term (by Uses

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it's relevant: I'll report the metric used, note ties (if any), provide totals, and offer to recompute with a different metric.
