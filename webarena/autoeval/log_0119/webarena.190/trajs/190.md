## Intent

Tell me the total cost of my latest complete order?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened the latest complete order (Order #000000180) and returned the requested total cost breakdown: Subtotal $40.32, Shipping & Handling $25.00, Tax: not shown on the order detail page, Grand Total $65.32. The order page in the snapshot shows the same order and does not display a tax line, so the agent either extracted the totals from the page or correctly stated tax isn't shown. The response therefore supplies the requested total cost or clearly indicates missing tax info.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Your latest complete order — Order # 000000180 (Order Date: March 11, 2023
