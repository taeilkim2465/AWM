## Intent

Show me the customers who have expressed dissatisfaction with Circe fleece?

## RM

Thoughts: The final page is an "Edit Review" for the product "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" showing a 1-star summary and detailed rating, nickname "Hannah Lim" and summary "Bad!" — this clearly identifies a customer who expressed dissatisfaction with the Circe fleece. The agent successfully navigated to and displayed the dissatisfied review (even if only one review is shown). 
Status: "success"
