## Intent

Create a new private project "llm_bulk_inference" and add primer, convexegg, abishek as members

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows the new project "llm_bulk_inference" in the sidebar and a success banner "Members were successfully added." The Project members list (Members 4) displays Convex Eggtart and Abishek S, and the owner Byte Blaze is present — implying the invited users were added (primer is likely the remaining member given the count and the add actions). This confirms the project was created and the specified members were added.
Status: "success"
