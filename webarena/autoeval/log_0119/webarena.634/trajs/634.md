## Intent

Ask for product recommendations for used iphone within a budget of $1000 in r/iphone

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the post title and body and selected r/iphone, but the final page shows the error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The submission was not posted, so the user's intent (to ask/post in r/iphone) was not completed. Although the agent correctly gathered clarifying details in a message, the site prevented the actual submission.
Status: "failure"

Wait a while before trying again.” Before I prepare recommendations (and verify live prices/links), I should collect a few details so my suggestions fit your needs. Please answer: 1) Your region/country and currency (or ZIP) so I can check local listings and taxes/shipping. 2) Do you require the phone to be unlocked (works on any carrier) or is carrier-locked OK? 3) Condition preference: acceptable battery health % (e.g., ≥85%), cosmetic tolerance (minor scratches vs like-new), and whether refurbished is OK. 4) Desired storage (e.g., 64/128/256/512GB). 5) Priorities among: best value, best camera, best performance — do you want 2–3 options covering those? 6) Any preferred sellers/marketplaces (eBay, Swappa, local classifieds, Amazon, Gazelle, etc.) or ones to avoid. 7) Do you want me to verify final price including shipping & tax for each recommendation before posting? \n\nAnswer these and tell me whether you want me to: A) prepare recommendations now and submit the post later when allowed, or B) just prepare the post text and hold off on submitting.")
