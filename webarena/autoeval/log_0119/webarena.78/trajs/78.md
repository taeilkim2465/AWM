## Intent

What is the total count of Approved reviews amongst all the reviews?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the total count of Approved reviews. The agent filtered Status to "Approved" and the page displays "346 records found" (visible in the screenshot). The agent reported "346," which matches the page count.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'The total number of Approved reviews is 346.'

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use list/grid filters to isolate a status when no total is shown): I will use this — filtering the reviews grid by status "Approved" is the most reliable way to get the total count if the UI doesn't show an aggregate.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (apply a status filter on the reviews grid to get the filtered count) because the interface likely doesn't show an aggregate count directly. I will not use Memory 2 (keyword search) because we need a status-based count, not keyword matches. I will not use Memory 3 (vote display verification) because vote counts are irrelevant to review status.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use list/grid filters to isolate a status when no total is shown) — I will use this. The Status filter is already set to "Approved" in the grid, so the grid's "records found" total should reflect Approved reviews.
