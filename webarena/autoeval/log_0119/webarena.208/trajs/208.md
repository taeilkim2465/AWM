## Intent

Find the customer name and email with phone number +1 2058812302

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent searched the phone number and selected a result. The final page snapshot clearly displays the selected row for "John Smith" with email "john.smith.xyz@gmail.com" and phone "2058812302" (ZIP 35213, Alabama), matching the user’s query (+1 prefix is consistent). The agent’s reported information matches the visible record, so the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Found matching customer:\n- Name: John Smith\n- Email: john.smith.xyz@gmail.com\n- Phone: +1 2058812302\n(Record also shows ZIP 35213, Alabama.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open order details to extract the customer name): I will not use this memory right now — it refers to opening an order after identifying a target order; first I should search the customers list directly for the phone number. If I can't find the customer in the customers list, I may use this later to inspect orders.
