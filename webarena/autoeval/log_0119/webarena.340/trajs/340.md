## Intent

List all opened issues that report bugs

## RM

Thoughts: The agent attempted to filter by label and returned two issues (#33 and #316) as open bugs. However the final page snapshot shows the issues list unfiltered (search box empty) and only #33 visibly labeled "type: bug" — #316 is not shown. Because the page state doesn't confirm the filter results and the agent's list appears to include an issue not visible on the page, it did not reliably list all open bug reports. Task failed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I found these OPEN issues labeled type: bug:\n\n1

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide how I find the open bug reports.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It suggests sorting by creation date to find the most recent open item, but the user wants all open issues that report bugs, so filtering by label is more relevant than sorting.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it? Yes. The page is already in the "Open" tab and the search field contains label:"type: bug", so Memory 1's approach (overview with Open filter + sort) matches the current view and confirms we should read the visible list.
