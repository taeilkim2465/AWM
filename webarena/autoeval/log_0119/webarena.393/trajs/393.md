## Intent

Post "lgtm" for the merge request related to fixing the broken links in byteblaze/empathy-prompts project

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent filled "lgtm" and clicked to submit; the final page snapshot displays a new activity comment by Byte Blaze containing "lgtm", indicating the comment was posted on the merge request for byteblaze/empathy-prompts. Therefore the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - We need to post "lgtm" on the merge request that fixes broken links. The memory items all recommend starting from the project's merge requests overview, which is exactly the right place to find and open the target MR.
