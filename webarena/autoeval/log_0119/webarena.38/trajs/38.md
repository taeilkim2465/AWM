## Intent

Check if the duquesne university in pittsburgh can be reached in one hour by car from pittsburgh airport

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent entered Pittsburgh International Airport and Duquesne University, invoked the OSRM routing, and the final webpage snapshot clearly displays "Distance: 28km. Time: 0:27." The agent's message correctly reports these results and answers the user's question (yes — reachable within one hour), and offers sensible follow-ups. This satisfies the information-seeking task.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I used the map routing result (OSRM

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use the memories because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - I will use the page's routing tool to compute a driving route and travel time (so I can check if it is within one hour).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify candidate airports with official addresses and a distance check): I will not use this now — the map already shows a routed trip and the user only asked whether Duquesne University can be reached within one hour by car from Pittsburgh airport. Fetching official postal addresses is extra work the user didn't request.

## Main Prompt

```md
User Intent: Check if the duquesne university in pittsburgh can be reached in one hour by car from pittsburgh airport

Action History:
1: click('149')
2: fill('158', 'Pittsburgh International Airport', True)
3: fill('163', 'Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, PA', True)
4: click('171')
5: send_msg_to_user("I used the map routing result (OSRM). The route from Pittsburgh International Airport to Duquesne University (Boulevard of the Allies / Duquesne University footbridge) is shown as 28 km and about 0:27 (27 minutes) by car — so yes, it can be reached within one hour by car. Assumptions: this is an OSRM routing estimate (typical/ideal traffic). If you want, I can (a) check live traffic or alternative routes, (b) fetch official postal addresses for formal verification, or (c) route from a different airport or a specific terminal/spot at PIT.")
