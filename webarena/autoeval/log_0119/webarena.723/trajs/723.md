## Intent

Like all submissions created by FTorrez81 in subreddit iphone13

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked the agent to like all submissions by FTorrez81 in subreddit iphone13 (a content-modification task). The action history shows only repeated searches for "FTorrez81 iphone13" and variants, and the final page snapshot displays "No results for FTorrez81 iphone13." The agent did not navigate to the subreddit or any user profile posts, nor did it perform any "like" actions; instead it prompted the user with options after finding no results. Because the required modifying action (liking the user's submissions) was never performed and the agent did not confirm that those posts exist or were liked, the task was not completed. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "The site search returned no results for 'FTorrez81 iphone13'. How would you like me to proceed? Options:\n1

===============INFO - Memory 1 (tailor forum posts) — NOT using: it's about drafting submissions and checking rules, which is unrelated to finding and upvoting posts.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about drafting and tailoring posts and checking subreddit rules; my current task is to locate submissions by a user, not to post.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 or Memory 2 because those are about drafting and preflight checks for posting to a subreddit — not relevant to locating a user's submissions. I will not use Memory 3 because it concerns posting restrictions, also not relevant to searching for existing submissions.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Tailor forum posts..." — I will NOT use this. It's about drafting posts and subreddit rules, which is irrelevant to finding or liking submissions.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Tailor forum posts and check community rules before posting" — I will NOT use this memory now because the task is to find existing submissions by FTorrez81, not to draft or post anything.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Tailor forum posts and check community rules): I will NOT use this memory now — it's about preparing submissions, but the current task is to find and like posts, not to create a post.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Tailor forum posts and check community rules before posting" — I will not use this memory right now because we haven't found any posts to post or repost; it's only relevant if we need to craft a submission for a community.
