## Intent

Create a private HTML repository called "web_agent_index" using the right template to speed up development.

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the existing "plain-html" project rather than a newly created repository named "web_agent_index". There is no evidence the agent selected a private visibility or completed a "create project from template" flow — the snapshot displays the example project details (commits, branch, README) not a new repo. Based on the action history and the page state, the requested private HTML repository was not created.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 (the template-creation checklists) because they explicitly remind me to confirm I'm in the "create from template" flow, choose the correct template, set visibility to private, and enter the repo name — exactly the steps needed to create the repository. I will not use Memory 3 right now because it is about adding files to a repo after creation, which is not needed yet.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It's a focused checklist for creating a repo from a template and will help ensure I pick the correct template, set visibility to private, and name the repo correctly.
===============INFO - I'll use the template-creation checklist memories to avoid missing steps.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Template-creation checklist): Use — it ensures I follow the create-from-template flow steps (confirm template flow, pick template, set private, name repo, review/create).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — the "Template-creation checklist for new repositories" is directly relevant to ensure I follow the correct flow (confirm create-from-template, pick label, set visibility to private, enter name, review, create).
