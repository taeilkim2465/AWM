{"id": 9, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for full addresses of all international airports within a 30 km driving distance of Carnegie Museum of Art. The agent computed driving routes (OSRM) from the museum to candidate airports, including Pittsburgh International Airport (snapshot shows route and \"Distance: 33km, Time: 0:32\") and attempted other airports (e.g., Allegheny County Airport). Pittsburgh International is 33 km (exceeds 30 km), and no international airports were found within the 30 km cutoff. The agent explicitly reported \"No international airports are within a 30 km driving distance\" and gave the nearest international airport's address from OpenStreetMap. This satisfies the information-seeking task (explicit negative result + supporting data).", "status": "success"}}
