## Intent

Tell me the full address of all international airports that are within a driving distance of 30 km to Carnegie Art Museum

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for full addresses of all international airports within a 30 km driving distance of Carnegie Museum of Art. The agent computed driving routes (OSRM) from the museum to candidate airports, including Pittsburgh International Airport (snapshot shows route and "Distance: 33km, Time: 0:32") and attempted other airports (e.g., Allegheny County Airport). Pittsburgh International is 33 km (exceeds 30 km), and no international airports were found within the 30 km cutoff. The agent explicitly reported "No international airports are within a 30 km driving distance" and gave the nearest international airport's address from OpenStreetMap. This satisfies the information-seeking task (explicit negative result + supporting data).  
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Result: No international airports are within a 30 km driving distance of Carnegie Museum of Art.\n\nNearest international airport (exceeds cutoff

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they both instruct me to obtain each airport’s official postal address from authoritative sources and to compute/verify driving distances from the Carnegie Museum before reporting results — that fits the user's request. I will also use Memory 3 to provide distance/time estimates with caveats and offer to fetch precise routing if needed.
===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide the workflow.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It instructs to fetch each airport’s official postal address and compute driving distances before reporting — that matches the user's requirement to list airports within 30 km driving distance.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - I will use the memories:
===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories as follows:
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories as guidance:
===============INFO - Memory 1 — Use: Yes. It tells me to verify candidate airports by getting official addresses and computing driving distances before reporting. I used the OpenStreetMap route panel to compute driving distance from Carnegie Museum of Art to the nearest international airport.

Which would you like me to do?")
