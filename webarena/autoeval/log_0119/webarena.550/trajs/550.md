## Intent

Add a new size XXS to blue and purple Nona Fitness Tank

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot shows the "Size" list and there is no "XXS" option present or selected — only XS, S, M, L, XL, etc. The action history contains only clicks and no evidence a new size value was created or added, and the Color section shows Blue selected but Purple isn't visible/selected in the snapshot. Because the required new size (XXS) was not created and associated with the blue and purple variants, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the next common size up) is not relevant for this task — the user specified the exact size (XXS) to add, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (Stepwise checklist for adding a product variant value) because it directly outlines the sequence needed to add a new size value to a product variant — it will guide the next steps. I will not use Memory 1 (Choose the next common size up) because it is about picking storage capacity and is not relevant to adding a size variant. I will not use Memory 3 (Confirm listing is a single item...) because that's about comparing product listings and prices, not editing product variants.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Choose the next common size up" — I will not use this. It's about picking storage capacity and doesn't apply to adding a size variant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the next common size up): Not relevant — this task is to add a specific size value (XXS), not to choose a capacity or size based on counts.
===============INFO - We need to add a new size option "XXS" and associate it with the blue and purple variants of the Nona Fitness Tank. Memory 2 (stepwise checklist for adding a product variant value) is directly relevant and I'll use it to guide the steps. Memory 1 (choosing a next size up) is not relevant. Memory 3 (confirm listing is a single item) is not relevant.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the next common size up) — not needed. This task is about adding a specific size option (XXS) to the product, not choosing a capacity.
===============INFO - Memory 1 ("Choose the next common size up") is not relevant for this task (it's about selecting storage capacity), so I will not use it.
