## Intent

What is the minimum travel time by car from CMU to University of Pittsburgh?

## RM

Thoughts: User intent is information-seeking (minimum car travel time). The agent filled start/end, generated the route, and reported the route tool's result "Distance 2.4 km. Time 0:04" (about 4 minutes). The final page snapshot clearly shows "Distance: 2.4km. Time: 0:04." The agent answered with the required information and an appropriate caveat/offering to recalculate — task succeeded.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "The route tool reports: Distance 2.4 km and Time 0:04 — about 4 minutes by car (for the CMU → University of Pittsburgh route entered

===============INFO - Memory 1 (use the map routing tool) — I will use this. The page has "From" and "To" fields and a Go button, so the routing tool is available and appropriate.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use the map routing tool) — use. I already ran the page's routing tool with CMU -> University of Pittsburgh and it returned a result.
