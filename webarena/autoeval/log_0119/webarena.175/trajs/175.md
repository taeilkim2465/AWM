## Intent

Open my latest updated issue that has keyword "dependency" in its title to check if it is closed

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent searched for "dependency" and opened an issue. The final page displays issue #18 "Outdated dependencies" with a green "Open" badge, so the agent successfully opened the latest-updated issue containing "dependency" and revealed that it is not closed (it's open). 
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 and Memory 2, and not use Memory 1.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 because the user asked for the "latest updated" issue and Memory 3 instructs to search across all statuses and sort by last-updated (descending). I'll also use Memory 2 to confirm the candidate is the latest before reporting its status. I will not use Memory 1 because it restricts to "Open" items and the user wants the latest updated issue regardless of status.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find the most recent open item via the overview list): I will NOT use this. It focuses on finding the most recent open item only, but the user asked for the most recently updated issue (across statuses) with "dependency" in its title.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find the most recent open item via the overview list): I will NOT use this. It filters for "Open" items and sorts by creation date; the user asked for the latest updated issue (not limited to open), so this would be the wrong approach.
===============INFO - We need to find the most recently updated issue whose title includes "dependency" and check whether it's closed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find the most recent open item): I will NOT use this—it's for finding the most recent open item only, but you asked for the latest updated issue across statuses with "dependency" in the title.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It applies to finding the most recent open item only; the user asked for the latest updated issue (any status), so Memory 3 is more relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find the most recent open item via the overview list): I will not use this. It restricts to Open items and sorts by creation date; the user asked for the "latest updated" issue (which could be closed), so Memory 1 is not appropriate.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3, but not Memory 1:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find most recent open item via overview): I will NOT use this — it filters to "Open" and sorts by creation date, but the user asked for the latest updated issue (across statuses) with "dependency" in the title.
