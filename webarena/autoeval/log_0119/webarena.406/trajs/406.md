## Intent

Upvote the newest post in future technology subreddit

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows the Futurology subreddit with the "New" sort active and the top post ("OpenAI CEO: It's Not Funny...") has an orange upvote arrow and a score of 1, indicating it has been upvoted. The action history corresponds to searching for the subreddit and clicking through; the final UI state confirms the newest post was upvoted.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the inline vote control to upvote quickly" — I will use this later to cast the upvote without opening the post, so YES for future steps.
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories to decide how to act:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (inline vote control): I will use this — it's the fastest way to upvote a listing item without opening the post.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (inline vote control) — I will use this: it's the quickest way to upvote without opening the post.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (inline vote control) because it's the fastest way to upvote from the listing without opening the post. I will use Memory 2 (ensure sort by New and ignore pinned entries) — the page shows "Sort by: New" and there are no visible pinned/stickied posts at the top, so the first non-pinned article is the newest. I will NOT use Memory 3 because gathering comments or filtering votes is not relevant to simply upvoting the newest post.
