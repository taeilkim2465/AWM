## Intent

Post a notice on a virtual meetup for book reading enthusiasts on March 15th in the r/books subreddit

## RM

Thoughts: This was a content-modification task (create a subreddit post). The agent filled the title and body correctly but encountered the subreddit rate-limit error ("You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.") and did not successfully submit the post. While the agent reported the problem and offered sensible next steps, the post was not created on r/books, so the task goal (posting the notice) was not achieved.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I can’t submit the post to r/books right now — the page shows a rate-limit message: “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.”\n\nOptions I can take now (pick one

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not useful for this step — it defines how to detect single-book recommendations, which is unrelated to creating an event post.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll not use Memory 1 or Memory 2 because they concern classifying single-book recommendations; this task is posting an event announcement, so those memories aren't relevant. Memory 3 (community suggestions) isn't needed because the user explicitly asked to post in r/books.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (single-book recommendation): NOT USING — this task is about posting a meetup notice, not classifying book-recommendation posts.

3: fill('142', "Hi r/books! We're hosting a virtual meetup for book-reading enthusiasts on March 15 at 7:00 PM UTC. \n\nFormat: brief introductions, a short shared reading, then group discussion. Everyone is welcome — whether you’re into fiction, non-fiction, poetry, or anything in between. \n\nIf you'd like to join, please RSVP in the comments or send me a DM and I'll share the meeting link (Zoom/Discord) with attendees. Feel free to suggest a short passage or book excerpt you'd like to read/discuss.\n\nPlease follow subreddit rules. Looking forward to seeing you there!\n\n— u/MarvelsGrantMan136")

7: send_msg_to_user("I can’t submit the post to r/books right now — the page shows a rate-limit message: “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.”\n\nOptions I can take now (pick one):\n1) Wait and retry later — tell me when to try (or I can retry after a short delay).\n2) Try to submit anyway (I can click the Create submission button now, but it will likely fail).\n3) Save the post text here so you can manually post later (I’ll paste the title + body for you to copy).\n4) Cross-post or post to alternative communities now — I recommend up to 2–3: r/bookclubs (topical), r/literature (high‑traffic), and r/ReadTogether (if you want an active reading group). I can adapt the title/body to each and attempt posting where allowed.\n5) Message the r/books moderators (if you want me to find the modmail link and prepare a message asking for an exception or clarification).\n\nWhich would you like me to do? If you choose option 4, tell me which alternative subreddits (or approve my suggestions) and I’ll prepare the posts.")
