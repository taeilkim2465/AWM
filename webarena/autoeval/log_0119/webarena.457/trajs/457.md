## Intent

Disable Karmen yoga pants from the site, they are facing some quality issues.

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent changed visibility (select_option to Not Visible Individually), focused and pressed the Enable Product toggle (press on '921' -> set to No as shown in the screenshot), and clicked the Save control (click('882')). The final page snapshot clearly shows "Enable Product" set to No for Karmen Yoga Pant, indicating the product has been disabled. Therefore the requested content modification was completed.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Verify product relevance and exclude bundles/accessories" — I will not use this memory now because we're already on the product edit page for "Karmen Yoga Pant" (a core product), and the user explicitly asked to disable it. No need to filter other listings.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (exclude bundles/accessories): Not needed for this step — we're working directly on the Karmen Yoga Pant configurable product and its variants, not collecting prices or excluding bundles.
===============INFO - I'll decide which memory items to use:
