## Intent

Tell me the distance to drive from Carnegie Mellon University to the top computer science school in massachusetts

## RM

Thoughts: The user requested the driving distance between CMU and the top CS school in Massachusetts. The agent filled origin (Warner Hall, 5000 Forbes Ave) and destination (Rotch Library, 77 Massachusetts Ave), ran the OSRM routing, and the page snapshot and directions panel show "Distance: 915km. Time: 11:29." The agent’s message correctly reports the 915 km (≈568.4 miles) driving distance, estimated time, route summary, and appropriate caveats. This satisfies the information-seeking task.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'I used Warner Hall (5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA

===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — the user didn't give a precise origin, so I'll assume Carnegie Mellon University's main campus address (5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213) and will state that assumption so the user can correct it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a specific, confirmed origin point when computing driving distances — YES. I already used "Warner Hall, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213" as the origin, which is a precise campus location; I'll keep that assumption unless you tell me otherwise.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. The user didn't supply a precise origin, so I'll adopt the authoritative CMU point already filled on the page (Warner Hall, 5000 Forbes Ave) and state that assumption so the user can correct it.
