If the seller’s policy or this order imposes any non‑refundable fees or excludes shipping from refunds, the amount could be lower (e.g., $2,111.32 if shipping were non-refundable). Also, because the payment method is Check / Money order, refund timing or method may differ. If you’d like, I can look for the store’s refund policy or contact info on the site to confirm whether shipping will be refunded.")
