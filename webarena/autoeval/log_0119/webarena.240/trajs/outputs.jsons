{"id": 240, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This is an information-seeking task \u2014 the agent needed to return the most expensive product in the competitive swimwear category or explicitly say it wasn't available. The action history shows searches and sorts and that the agent opened a product page (showing a $64.26 swimwear item). However there is no explicit evidence the agent confirmed that this is the most expensive item (no statement of \"most expensive\" or of sorting high-to-low), and the page snapshot only shows a single product without demonstrating it is the top-priced item in the category. The agent also did not present the requested information in text form. Therefore the task requirement (provide the most expensive product) was not satisfactorily met.", "status": "failure"}}
