{"id": 285, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the least expensive Switch card holder that holds at least 15 cards. The action history shows repeated searches and attempts to sort by price, but the final page snapshot only shows the search results header and related search terms with the \"Sort By\" still set to Relevance and no product listings or prices visible. There's also no evidence a capacity filter (>=15 cards) was applied or that a specific cheapest item was selected and reported. For an information-seeking task the agent must return the actual product (or explicitly say it's unavailable); that did not happen here.", "status": "failure"}}
