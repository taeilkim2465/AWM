## Intent

Show the least expensive switch card holder with a minimum storage capacity of 15 cards.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the least expensive Switch card holder that holds at least 15 cards. The action history shows repeated searches and attempts to sort by price, but the final page snapshot only shows the search results header and related search terms with the "Sort By" still set to Relevance and no product listings or prices visible. There's also no evidence a capacity filter (>=15 cards) was applied or that a specific cheapest item was selected and reported. For an information-seeking task the agent must return the actual product (or explicitly say it's unavailable); that did not happen here. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prefer a case sized to your collection or the next standard capacity up" — I will use this. It tells me to prefer listings that explicitly state capacity so I can be confident a product holds at least 15 cards.
===============INFO - Memory check — I'll decide whether to use each memory item before proceeding:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer a case sized to your collection or the next standard capacity up): USE. It's relevant because we need at least 15-card capacity and should prefer listings that explicitly state capacity.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer a case sized to your collection or the next standard capacity up): I will use this — the user requested minimum 15-card capacity, so I'll prioritize listings that explicitly state capacity or are the next common size up (e.g., 16, 18, 24).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It advises preferring a product whose listed capacity matches or slightly exceeds your needed number of cartridges; that's directly relevant because you asked for at least 15-card capacity.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prefer a case sized to your collection or the next standard capacity up): I will use this — it tells us to prefer listings that explicitly state capacity or the next standard size up, which matches the user's 15-card minimum requirement.
