## Intent

Delete all reviews from the scammer Arden

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a confirmation banner "A total of 1 record(s) have been deleted." The filter has Nickname = "Arden" and the grid reports "0 records found" / "We couldn't find any records." These indicate the review(s) by Arden were removed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The memory about applying filters to surface only relevant reviews (pending/negative) is helpful — I'll look for review filters after opening the Marketing section so I can target reviews from the specific reviewer.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I'll apply search/filters once I open the reviews list to narrow results to the reviewer and statuses we need.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Filter or search to surface only 'pending' and 'negative' reviews" — I WILL use this memory. It recommends using filters/search to narrow results; I'll apply the nickname filter to surface reviews by Arden before deleting them.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Filter or search to surface only 'pending' and 'negative' reviews" — I will not use this memory now because the grid is already filtered by nickname "Arden" and shows the single review we need to remove.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter to pending/negative): I will NOT use this — the user asked to delete all reviews from "Arden" regardless of status or sentiment.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Filter or search to surface only 'pending' and 'negative' reviews" — I will NOT use this now because I already filtered by nickname "Arden" and the single matching review is visible. Additional filtering for pending/negative isn't necessary for this deletion.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Filter or search to surface only 'pending' and 'negative' reviews" — I will not use this memory now because you've already filtered by nickname 'Arden' and the table shows 1 matching record. No additional filtering is required.
