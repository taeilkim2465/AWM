## Intent

Pull up the description page of Carnegie Mellon University on Map

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the search box and clicked Go, producing the OpenStreetMap Nominatim search results for "Carnegie Mellon University" (visible in the left pane). However it did not open any result's description/details page — the results list is shown rather than a specific place description. Therefore the requested description page was not pulled up.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. I'll assume the user means Carnegie Mellon University's main campus in Pittsburgh (I will state that assumption so you can correct it if needed).
