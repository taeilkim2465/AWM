{"id": 123, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for reasons why customers like Circe's products. The agent's sent message already provides five clear, non-overlapping reason categories with supporting notes and a brief negatives list, and it offers follow-up presentation options and requests for review text if exact quotes are wanted. That satisfies an information-seeking task (it supplies the requested reasons and next steps). The webpage snapshot (admin dashboard) is unrelated but doesn't affect the response. Therefore the agent completed the user's request successfully.", "status": "success"}}
