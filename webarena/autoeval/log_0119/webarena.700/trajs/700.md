## Intent

Draft a new marketing price rule for fall discount that offers $10 discount on checkout for all customers

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for a draft of a new marketing cart price rule for a $10 checkout discount for all customers. The agent responded with a complete proposed draft (rule name, description, active state, websites, customer groups = all, no coupon, discount type = fixed cart $10, discard subsequent rules, optional dates) and asked the user to confirm before creating it in the admin UI. The admin page in the snapshot is still blank (the rule has not yet been created), but the user’s intent was to draft the rule — which the agent fulfilled and clearly offered to proceed with creation after confirmation.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Here is a proposed draft for the new marketing cart price rule. Please review and tell me if you want any changes (dates, coupon behavior, customer groups, etc.

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not useful — it explains percentage-based rules, but we need a fixed $10 checkout discount.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (set discount action/type) — Not relevant: this task uses a fixed $10 discount, not a percentage.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Set the discount action and value to the correct type): NOT USING. This rule is a fixed $10 discount (not a percentage), so the guidance about choosing a percentage action is not applicable.
