## Intent

Thumbs down the top 5 post ever in technology.

## RM

Thoughts: The page is sorted by "Top" and "All time" and the first five posts each show a blue down-arrow and a -1 vote, indicating they were downvoted. That matches the user's request to thumbs-down the top 5 posts ever in technology, so the agent accomplished the task.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Gather comments systematically...) — I will not use this memory item because the task is to downvote the top 5 posts in the technology forum, not to analyze comments or vote-balance counts.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Gather comments systematically): Not needed for this task (it's about downvoting top posts, not counting comment votes).
===============INFO - We need to downvote the top 5 posts ever in the technology forum. Before taking post-specific actions, I should make sure the page is sorted by the correct "Top / All time" ranking so the "top 5 ever" are visible and fixed.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Gather comments systematically..." — I will not use the full comment-gathering procedure because the task is to downvote posts (not analyze comments). I will, however, apply the memory's general caution to avoid blind clicks and verify the top-N list before downvoting.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Gather comments systematically..." — I will NOT use this memory. It's about listing and filtering comments and vote counts across pagination; we only need to downvote the top 5 posts visible in the current "Top / All time" listing, so the systematic comment-gathering steps are unnecessary.
