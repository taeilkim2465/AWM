## Intent

I have a lot of Nintendo Switch game cards now, help me find the best storage option to fit all 6 cards

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for "Nintendo Switch game card case 6", opened a product page, and the final page clearly shows a case that holds up to 24 game cards (sufficient for the user's 6 cards), with price and availability visible. The agent therefore located an appropriate storage option that fits all 6 cards. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (prioritize listings that state capacity): I will use this — it's important to quickly identify products that explicitly show how many game cards they hold so we can confirm a fit for 6 cards without opening many pages.
