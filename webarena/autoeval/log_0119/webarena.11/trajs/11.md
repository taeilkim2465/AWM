## Intent

Tell me the the number of reviews that our store received by far that mention term "disappointed"

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot clearly shows "6 records found" in the reviews grid and visible rows (IDs 353 and 351) contain the word "disappointed" in the Review column.

Status: "success"
