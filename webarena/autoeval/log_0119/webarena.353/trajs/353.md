## Intent

List products from competitive swimwear category by ascending price

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent performed a search for "competitive swimwear", set sorting to Price (ascending), and returned the products shown on page 1 in ascending price order (12 items, $0.99 → $8.83). The agent also noted that some results are not strictly competitive swimwear and offered sensible next steps (verify listings, fetch more pages, apply filters). The response therefore supplies the requested information and acknowledges limitations, so the execution meets the user's intent.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Here are the products shown on page 1 (sorted by ascending price

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It reminds me to verify each product is a single competitive-swimwear item and to note the price units/exclusions before listing results.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (confirm single-item listings) — I will not use it right now; that's for verifying item-level details later if we need precise per-unit price checks.
===============INFO - Memory items:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm listing is a single item and clarify price units and exclusions): I will use this memory, but I won't open every product page yet. I'll first report the results visible on the current page, then — if you want — I can inspect individual product pages to confirm single-unit pricing, currency, and rule out bundles/multipacks.
