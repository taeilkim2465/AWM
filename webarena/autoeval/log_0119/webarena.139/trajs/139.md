Thoughts: The agent set Scranton (used as Biden’s hometown) and Bridgeport, ran the Car (OSRM) route, and reported "Distance ≈ 264 km, Estimated driving time ≈ 3 hr 24 min". The webpage snapshot's Directions panel shows "Distance: 264km. Time: 3:24." The response gives the requested estimated driving time (with sensible caveats), so the information-seeking task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"
