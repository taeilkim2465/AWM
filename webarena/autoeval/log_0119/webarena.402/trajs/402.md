## Intent

Change my reddit bio to "Freelance Web Developer"

## RM

Thoughts: The biography field shows "Freelance Web Developer", the preview and the profile sidebar display the same text, and there is a green confirmation message "The biography was updated." These indicate the bio change was successfully saved.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 now: open the profile/account menu so the "edit profile" option becomes visible. Memory 1 (fill the bio and save) is relevant but applies after the edit interface is open, so I will use it in a later step. Memory 3 (clear the existing bio before filling) is also relevant for the actual bio update and I'll apply it once the bio field is visible.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide this step.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Fill the bio and explicitly save changes): I will use this. The page shows a biography textarea and a Save button, so I'll enter the new bio and save.
