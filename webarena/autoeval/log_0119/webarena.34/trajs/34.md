## Intent

I will arrive Pittsburgh Airport soon. Provide the name of a Hyatt hotel in the vicinity, if available. Then, tell me the the shortest walking time to a supermarket from the hotel.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent located "Hyatt Place Pittsburgh Airport" (matches the user's request for a Hyatt near PIT) but the routing shown is 701 km with Time: 155:23 (walking) — i.e., a cross‑state route to a grocery store near New York, not a nearby supermarket. The agent therefore did not find the nearest supermarket or provide the actual shortest walking time from the hotel to a local supermarket. This does not satisfy the user's second requirement, so the task failed.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this. It is important to compute walking routes (walking mode) from the hotel's exact location to supermarkets to get accurate walking times.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use mapping/directions tool with walking mode): I will use this memory later after finding the hotel's exact address or coordinates to compute walking routes to nearby supermarkets. For now I do not use it.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide the next steps:
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode): I will use this — I need walking directions/times from the hotel's exact location to nearby supermarkets, so I'll later compute pedestrian routes (or use a map's routing feature).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use mapping/directions with walking mode): I will use this. To report a reliable walking time I need the hotel's exact location and to request pedestrian directions to nearby supermarkets.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to plan the next action.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — I should use a walking/directions tool to get an accurate pedestrian time. The page has a directions form with a transport-mode combobox (currently Car); switching to Foot (OSRM) will compute walking time.
===============INFO - Memory 1 — Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode: YES. I will use walking-mode directions (Foot/OSRM is already selected) to get an accurate walking time once I search nearby supermarkets.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
