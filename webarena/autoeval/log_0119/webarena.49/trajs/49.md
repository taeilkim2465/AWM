## Intent

Today is 6/12/2023. Tell me how many fulfilled orders I have over the past four month, and the total amount of money I spent.

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent interpreted "fulfilled" as orders with Status "Complete", set the date range to 2/12/2023–6/12/2023 (four months before 6/12/2023), expanded the list to show 50 per page, and scanned all shown orders (37). The three "Complete" orders in that date range (000000180 — $65.32, 000000166 — $17.99, 000000161 — $762.18) sum to $845.49, which matches the agent's reported results. The agent also offered reasonable follow-ups. Therefore the agent fulfilled the user's request.  
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (map/confirm "fulfilled"): I will use this. Before totaling I'll look in the account/orders UI to see which status label corresponds to "fulfilled" (for example "Complete" or "Shipped") and use that mapping consistently.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will confirm which order status label corresponds to "fulfilled" (e.g., "Complete") before totaling.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (map "fulfilled"): I will use this. The UI shows a "Status" column with labels like "Complete", "Pending", "Canceled". I'll treat "Complete" as the "fulfilled" status (per Memory 1). If you prefer a different mapping, tell me and I will adjust.
===============INFO - I'll consider each memory item before proceeding.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. The page shows order statuses like "Complete" and "Canceled". I'll treat "Complete" as the equivalent of "fulfilled" and use it consistently (per Memory 1).
