## Intent

Tell me when I last ordered my body butter?

## RM

Thoughts: The My Orders page is visible showing order numbers and dates but no line‑item/product details. The action history only shows navigating and changing items-per-page; there is no evidence the agent opened any individual "View Order" to inspect order contents or searched for "body butter". Without viewing order details, the agent cannot determine which order contained the body butter or when it was last ordered. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the saved memories because they tell me the proper process for finding a most-recent order: go to the orders overview, apply relevant filters (e.g., product/status), sort by date descending, and open the top item to confirm details.
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories to ensure I find the most recent order for the body butter correctly:
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories about how to find the most recent order:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the orders overview with filters and sorting to identify the correct 'most recent' order." — I will use this guidance (yes). It reminds me to start from the orders list sorted by date (newest first) rather than assuming an open order is the right one.
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories because they instruct to find the most recent relevant order by using the orders overview with filters and sorting before assuming the open order is the most recent one.
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories to guide the search:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the orders overview with filters and sorting to identify the correct "most recent" order.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (yes) because it reminds me to use the orders overview and sort/filter by date to locate the most recent order. The orders page is already sorted newest-first, so that's helpful. I will not use Memory 2 (no) because it specifically recommends applying a status filter — the user did not request a particular status. I will use Memory 3 (yes) to open the exact order record before confirming product details (we must inspect order details to find "body butter").
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the orders overview with filters and sorting..." — I will not use this. The user asked for the last time they ordered a specific product (body butter), not for a most-recent order by status, and there are no visible status filters on this page to apply.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the orders overview with filters and sorting to identify the correct "most recent" order — I will use this. To find the last time the user ordered "body butter" I need to search/filter the orders list and sort by date descending.
