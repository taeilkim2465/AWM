## Intent

Promote koush/AndroidAsync to subreddit funny with the description from the repo itself.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the URL, title, and body and selected r/funny, then attempted to submit. The final page snapshot clearly shows the error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." and no successful submission was made. Although the agent provided ready-to-paste text and next steps to the user, the actual task—posting/promoting koush/AndroidAsync to r/funny—was not completed by the agent itself.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I can’t submit automatically right now — the site shows: \"You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.\" Here are ready-to-paste items and next steps:\n\n1

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide posting behavior:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items to guide this post so it follows best practices and to prepare a fallback in case automated submission fails.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use? Yes. It reminds me to have the prepared title/body as a fallback if automated posting fails — I'll keep that in mind.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prepare reusable, copy-ready post content and fallback actions): I will use this — the site blocked posting, so I should provide copy-ready title/body and fallback options for manual posting.

That will work immediately.\n- Retry later: Wait a bit and I can try to submit again for you.\n- Check r/funny rules before posting: https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/about/rules to ensure the post fits community rules (link-only or promotional posts may be disallowed).\n- If you want, I can craft a version tailored to r/funny (a humorous or meme-style title) to increase acceptance likelihood.\n\nWhich would you like me to do next? (Retry submission later, prepare a funnier title, check r/funny rules now, or provide anything else.)")
