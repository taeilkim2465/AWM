## Intent

What is the price range for products from Amazon basic?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent performed the search, extracted prices from the 12 visible listings, and clearly reported a price range ($5.49 — $216.32) while explicitly stating this is based on the displayed items (1–12 of 7,332) and offering to expand the search to find overall min/max. This fulfills the information-seeking requirement by providing the requested information and noting the limitation and next steps.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Based on the 12 visible listings on this page, the price range is $5.49 — $216.32. This is computed from the displayed prices (items 1–12 of 7,332
