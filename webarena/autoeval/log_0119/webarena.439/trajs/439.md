## Intent

I previously ordered some a cat t-shirt during 2022 and later cancelled. Can you reorder it for me?

## RM

Thoughts: The action history ends with scrolling and selecting options but no click on any "Reorder" link or Add to Cart for the cancelled cat t‑shirt. The final page shows the order list (with "View Order" / "Reorder" links visible), but the agent never selected the specific 2022 cancelled cat t‑shirt order or invoked a reorder action, so the reorder was not completed.  
Status: failure
