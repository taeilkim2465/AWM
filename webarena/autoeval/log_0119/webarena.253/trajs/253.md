## Intent

What is the phone number of Carnegie Mellon Café

## RM

Thoughts: The user sought a phone number (information seeking). The agent only searched OpenStreetMap Nominatim (no results) and then asked a clarifying question/offered to search the wider web, but did not provide the requested phone number or explicitly state it is unavailable. Because the response did not deliver the phone number or a definitive unavailable conclusion, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prioritize on-page scanning for contact information" — I will not use this memory now because the current page is a map (OpenStreetMap), not a Contact/Help page, so exhaustive on-page scanning of a contact page isn't applicable.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It tells me to thoroughly scan the current page for a phone number first. I already searched on this OpenStreetMap Nominatim page and the results show "No results found", so I'll scroll and inspect the page to be sure there isn't any hidden contact info.
