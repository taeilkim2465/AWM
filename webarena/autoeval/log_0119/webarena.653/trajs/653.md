## Intent

Fill the "contact us" form in the site for a refund on the phone screen protector I bought, stating that it broke after just three days of use. Also, ensure to include the order number #000000180 and the product SKU. Don't submit yet, I will check.

## RM

Thoughts: This is a content-modification task. The user asked the agent to fill the contact form with a refund request including order #000000180 and the product SKU, and not to submit. The page snapshot shows Name and Email filled but the Phone field still contains [PHONE_NUMBER] and the message textarea only contains "Phone: [PHONE_NUMBER]\n\nThank you for your help." — it does not include the order number or the product SKU. The agent also asked the user for the SKU and phone number instead of completing the form. Because the required order/SKU information is not present on the final page, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I’m ready to finish filling the form but need two things from you before editing: 1

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to craft the message for the Contact Us form:
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as guidance to craft a brief, factual message that requests a refund, offers supporting evidence, and includes placeholders the user can replace before submission.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it matches the user's request to keep the message brief, factual, and include contact placeholders. I will keep the body concise if the user agrees.
