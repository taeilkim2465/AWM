{"id": 153, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the minimum driving time from REI to CMU. The agent only clicked once and asked a clarification (whether Pittsburgh is intended) instead of computing or reporting a route/time. The directions panel on the page is empty, so no travel time was obtained or reported. For an information-seeking task the agent must return the requested time (or explicitly say it's unavailable); asking for clarification without providing the information means the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
