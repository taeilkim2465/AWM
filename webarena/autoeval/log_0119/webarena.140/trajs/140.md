## Intent

What is the estimated driving time between the city of Niagara Falls and the city of Yale University?

## RM

Thoughts: The user requested an estimated driving time. The agent used the map routing tool, filled origin/destination, ran directions, and the final page clearly shows "Distance: 689km. Time: 8:50". The agent's reply correctly reported ~8 hours 50 minutes and ≈689 km and offered sensible follow-ups. This satisfies an information-seeking task.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Using the map routing tool, the estimated driving time is about 8 hours 50 minutes (distance ≈ 689 km

===============INFO - I will use the page's routing tool to get a driving-time estimate (Memory 1) because it gives the most accurate route-based estimate. I will also keep in mind to report the estimate with clear caveats about variability (Memory 2) and offer to fetch precise directions or adjust endpoints if needed (Memory 3).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the map routing tool): YES — I will use the page's routing tool to get a driving-time estimate by filling the origin and destination fields and running the route.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the map routing tool to get distance and driving-time estimates — Yes. The page already ran the routing tool (OSRM) between Niagara Falls and Yale University and shows the result.

Would you like turn-by-turn directions, a different route option (e.g., avoid tolls), or a recalculation for a specific departure time?')
