## Intent

Add the product with the lowest per unit price from my open tabs to the shopping cart

Thoughts: The user asked to add the product with the lowest per‑unit price from their open tabs. The agent only asked a clarification ("Do you mean across all your browser tabs?...") and did not compute per‑unit prices or scan other tabs.

Because the required selection/comparison step was not performed, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"
