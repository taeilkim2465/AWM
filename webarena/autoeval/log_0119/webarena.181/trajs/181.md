## Intent

Open my latest created issue that has theme editor in its title to check if it is closed

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened the issue titled "Tm Theme Editor" (visible on the page) and the page clearly shows a green "Open" badge and a "Close issue" button, so the issue is not closed. The agent reported it as Open and offered sensible next steps, so the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I opened the issue titled “Tm Theme Editor”. It is currently Open (not closed

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Find the most recent open item via the overview list" — I will NOT use this. It is specific to finding the most recent open item from an overview with status filter set to Open, but the user asked for the latest created issue with "theme editor" in the title (status unspecified), so this memory is not appropriate.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It suggests applying an "Open" status filter and sorting by creation date; the page already shows the Open list, and the matching item is visible, so I won't reapply that filter now.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter Open + sort by newest): I will NOT use this — it restricts to Open issues only and the user asked for the latest created issue with "theme editor" in the title across statuses.
