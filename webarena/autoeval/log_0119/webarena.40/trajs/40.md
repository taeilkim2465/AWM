## Intent

Check if the amc theatre in pittsburgh can be reached in one hour by car from hobart street

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to check driving time (can an AMC theatre in Pittsburgh be reached within one hour from Hobart Street). The agent filled origin/destination but did not compute or report a travel time or state that it couldn't find one; instead it asked a clarification about which AMC location to use. For an information-seeking task the agent must provide the requested travel-time result (or explicitly say it's unavailable). Asking which specific AMC is reasonable given ambiguity, but the agent did not deliver the requested information or a definitive failure message, so the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Which AMC theatre in Pittsburgh do you mean? There are multiple locations (for example: AMC Loews Waterfront 22 in Homestead, AMC at Monroeville, etc.

===============INFO - I'll use the page's routing tool to get an estimated driving time (Memory 1). I'll also follow the guidance to report the estimate with caveats and offer to fetch a precise route if needed (Memory 2). Memory 3 (walking-mode routing) is not relevant for a car driving-time check, so I won't use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this — it tells me to use the page's routing tool with clear origin and destination, which is exactly what I plan to do.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. It instructs to run the page's routing tool with clear origin/destination, which I already filled and should use to get driving time.
===============INFO - Memory 1 is relevant and I'll use it: the routing tool is already filled with origin and destination, so I should run it to get the driving time estimate.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. The page has the map routing tool with origin "Hobart Street, Pittsburgh, PA" and destination "AMC Theatre Pittsburgh, PA" filled; I should run the routing tool to get driving time.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the map routing tool — I will use this. The origin and destination are already filled in the routing form, so running the page's routing tool is the right next step to get an estimated driving time.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the map routing tool): Yes — I should use the page's routing tool to get a driving-time estimate, and a precise endpoint improves accuracy.
