{"id": 40, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked to check driving time (can an AMC theatre in Pittsburgh be reached within one hour from Hobart Street). The agent filled origin/destination but did not compute or report a travel time or state that it couldn't find one; instead it asked a clarification about which AMC location to use. For an information-seeking task the agent must provide the requested travel-time result (or explicitly say it's unavailable). Asking which specific AMC is reasonable given ambiguity, but the agent did not deliver the requested information or a definitive failure message, so the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
