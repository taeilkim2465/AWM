## Intent

Get the date of the most recent canlled order

## RM

Thoughts: The Orders page shows the active filter "Status: Canceled" and the top row (order 000000136) has Purchase Date "May 23, 2023 9:20:01 PM" with Status "Canceled", which matches the agent's reported date. The agent provided the requested information correctly.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'The most recent canceled order date is: May 23, 2023 9:20:01 PM.'

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (use explicit status filters and sort by date) because the task asks for the most recent cancelled order — applying a status filter for "Cancelled" and sorting by date is the most reliable approach.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Select the latest non-cancelled order" — I will NOT use this memory because the user specifically asked for the most recent cancelled order; Memory 1 would instruct avoiding cancelled orders which conflicts with the request.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Select the latest non-cancelled order): NOT USE — it's about non-cancelled orders, but the user asked for the most recent cancelled order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use? Yes — it's relevant: we must make sure we pick the most recent order that is not cancelled (or in this case find the most recent cancelled one), so I'll follow its guidance.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (select latest non-cancelled order) is NOT useful — the user asked for the most recent cancelled order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Select the latest non-cancelled order" — I will NOT use this. It's about non-cancelled orders, but the user asked for the most recent cancelled order.
