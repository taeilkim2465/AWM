## Intent

Buy the highest rated product from the Ceiling light category within a budget above 1000.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to buy the highest-rated ceiling light within a budget > $1,000. The agent only performed a search, changed sort to Relevance, scrolled, and then asked a clarification about what "budget above $1,000" means and whether to proceed to checkout. The agent did not identify the highest-rated item, apply a price filter, select a product, or add it to the cart/complete purchase. Since the required purchase action was not completed, the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Sort and verify by rating before selecting): I will use this. The user wants the highest-rated product, so I should try to sort or filter by rating and then verify price and rating before opening product pages. The page's "Sort By" control currently offers Product Name / Price / Relevance but not an explicit "Rating" option — still, the memory's guidance to prioritize rating is relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Sort and verify by rating before selecting): I will use this — the user wants the highest-rated product, so I should try to surface top-rated items and then verify their prices meet the >1000 budget.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It advises to sort/filter by rating and validate top candidates' price and rating before opening product pages. Even though the site doesn't offer a "rating" sort, I will follow the spirit of this memory: focus on finding items with visible rating info and then open those to confirm price > 1000.
