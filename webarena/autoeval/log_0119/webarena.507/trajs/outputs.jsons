The agent only performed a search, changed sort to Relevance, scrolled, and then asked a clarification about what \"budget above $1,000\" means and whether to proceed to checkout. The agent did not identify the highest-rated item, apply a price filter, select a product, or add it to the cart/complete purchase. Since the required purchase action was not completed, the task is incomplete.", "status": "failure"}}
