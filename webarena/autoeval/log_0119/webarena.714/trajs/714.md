===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (Confirm and lock the "top N" list) because before downvoting I should load the gadgets forum and verify the top-ranked posts (so I don't act on the wrong listing). I'll not use Memory 2 (gather comments) because the task is only to downvote the top post, not to collect comments. I will use Memory 3 (use the inline vote control) — it's faster and avoids opening the post, so I'll aim to click the downvote button next to the top listing once I have the gadgets "top" list.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 to confirm the exact top item list before opening posts (so I don't downvote the wrong post). I will not use Memory 2 (it's about gathering comments, not needed for a simple downvote). I will use Memory 3 because the inline vote control next to a listing is the fastest way to cast a downvote without opening the post — I'll prefer that once I get to the gadgets subreddit sorted by top/all time.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3, but not Memory 2.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm and lock the "top N" list): I will use this. Before casting a downvote I should confirm the exact top-1 post after switching the sort to "Top" (and time range if needed) so I don't vote on the wrong item.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm and lock the "top N" list before inspecting items): I will use this. The page currently shows "There's nothing here…" because the time filter is set to "Past 24 hours." Before opening any post or voting, I should switch the time filter to the full range and record the top post listing so I can be sure I'm targeting the true #1 post.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Confirm and lock the "top N" list) because the task requires operating on the "top 1" post and it's important to ensure the correct ranked list (time range and sort) is set before voting. I will not use Memory 2 (gather comments) because it pertains to collecting and filtering comments, which is unrelated to downvoting the top post. I will use Memory 3 (use inline vote control) as a preferred method to cast a vote quickly once the top post is visible.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it — I should confirm the top-N list before acting. The page is already sorted "Top / All time" and the top item visible is "A custom gaming PC built inside a vintage 1940s Motorola radio case" (score 11533). That is the top-1 post to target.
