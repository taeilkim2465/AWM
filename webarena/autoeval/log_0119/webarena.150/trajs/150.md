## Intent

What is the price configuration of the fake tree I bought Jan 2023

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the January 29, 2023 order page, extracted the item line showing a 2-pack price of $260.69 (qty 1 / subtotal $260.69) and computed the per-tree price ($260.69 ÷ 2 = $130.345 → $130.35). That directly answers the user's request about the price configuration. The additional mention of shipping & grand total doesn't affect that core information. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Order Date: January 29, 2023\n\nItem: Bornbridge Artificial Spiral Topiary Tree (4' Boxwood

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because before checking orders I need to ensure any date-range or status filters don't hide the Jan 2023 order. Memory 2 and Memory 3 (price-range computations from listings) are not needed right now — I first need to open the account/orders page to find the specific order and its price breakdown; those memories could help later if I need to compute ranges from multiple listings.
===============INFO - Memory 1 is relevant — I should check for any active date-range or status filters before determining details about a Jan 2023 order, so I'll open the full orders list and inspect filters.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (check/lock date-range or status filters): I will use this memory. I should confirm there are no active date/status filters visible and ensure we can see the full order history. I don't see a date-range control, so the quickest way to include older orders (including Jan 2023) is to increase the "Show per page" value so all orders are visible.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about checking date-range filters for "first purchase" questions; we are looking at a specific order page already showing January 29, 2023, so no filter adjustments needed.
