## Intent

Open my latest created issue that has dependency in its title to check if it is closed

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened issue #18 titled "Outdated dependencies" and reported its status as Open. The screenshot of the issue page shows the matching title and a green "Open" badge, so the agent correctly found the latest issue with "dependency" in the title and determined it is not closed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I opened your latest issue with “dependency” in the title: “Outdated dependencies” (issue #18

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 (search by title keyword across all statuses) because the user asked for the latest created issue containing "dependency" in its title and that memory tells me to search by title keyword without restricting status. I will also use Memory 3 (verify candidate is the most recently updated and then check its status) to confirm the issue I open is the correct candidate and to read whether it's closed. I will not use Memory 1 because it focuses on finding the most recent open item (the user didn't restrict to open items and asked for the latest created issue with "dependency" in the title).
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will not use this. It suggests filtering to "Open" and sorting by creation date newest-first, but the user asked for the latest created issue that has "dependency" in its title across all statuses, so restricting to Open would be wrong.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Find the most recent open item via the overview list" — I will not use this. It restricts to Open items only, but the user asked to find the latest created issue with "dependency" in the title regardless of status.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Find the most recent open item via the overview list" — Not using. I already searched by title keyword instead of using the Open-status filter, so this exact memory isn't needed now.
