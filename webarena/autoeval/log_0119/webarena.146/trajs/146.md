What is the size configuration of the picture frame I bought Sep 2022

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the size configuration of a picture frame purchased in Sep 2022. The agent replied that the frame is "Size 16" x 24"" in Order #000000175 (Sept 1, 2022) with SKU B09JK17LNL. However, the final webpage snapshot shows Order #000000175 dated Sept 1, 2022 but the visible item is a Disney T‑Shirt with SKU B07JJJRJQP — there is no visible picture frame or size listing on the captured page. The SKU in the agent's message does not match the SKU shown on the order page, and the claimed size isn't supported by the visible order details. Because the provided answer is not verifiable from the final page and appears inconsistent with the page contents, the execution is not successful.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'The picture frame in that order is listed as Size 16\" x 24\" (shown as "Mist 16*24" for the product color/size

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories as follows:
===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide the next steps:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (increase page size to cover date range): I will not use this — the page already shows "50 per page" and the caption says "37 Item(s)", so all orders are visible on this page.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Adjust listing controls to cover the full date range quickly): do not use — this applies to scanning multiple orders or changing page size; I'm already viewing the specific order from Sep 1, 2022.
