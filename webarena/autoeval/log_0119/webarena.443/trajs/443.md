## Intent

Update the project site's title to "Not an interesting site"

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted the project site's title changed to "Not an interesting site". The agent only clicked 'index.html' and '1175' but there is no evidence of editing or committing a changed title. The final page snapshot still shows the original project title ("gimmietthat.space") and description, so the requested update was not performed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Avoid altering unrelated fields when only updating the title): I will use this. The task is a simple title change, so I should avoid touching other settings or metadata.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to only change the title and not touch other fields.
