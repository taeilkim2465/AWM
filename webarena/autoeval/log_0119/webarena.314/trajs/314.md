## Intent

List the name of the top 3 contributors to prime/design repo, ranked by the number of commits?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent opened the repository's Contributors view and returned the top three contributors with commit counts, ordered by commits. The page snapshot confirms the contributors view and the counts for the top two (Shawn Allen — 95, Inayaili León — 77); the agent provided the requested ranked list and cited the Contributors view. This meets the information-seeking requirement.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the repository's Contributors/Insights view as the primary source for top committers — I will use this (yes). It's the fastest authoritative place to get commit counts.

===============INFO - I will use the repository's Contributors/Insights view as the primary source of commit counts (Memory 1 and Memory 2) because that page aggregates per-contributor commit counts and is the fastest authoritative source. I'll also apply Memory 3 to confirm I'm looking at the main/original repository (not a fork) once the Contributors page loads.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the repository's Contributors/Insights view as the primary source — Yes, I'll use this memory because I'm reading the Contributors page on the hosting platform (GitLab), which is the authoritative place for commit counts.
