## Intent

Draft a refund message via their "contact us" form for the bluetooth speaker I bought Feb 2023. It broke after three days of use. The shop requires the order id, the reason and the amount to refund in the message. Don't submit yet

## RM

Thoughts: The agent provided a clear refund message draft that includes the required order ID, reason, and requested refund amount (with placeholders where the user must fill exact Order ID and amount). It also asked the correct follow-up questions (shipping/taxes inclusion, photos/evidence, whether to submit). The user requested not to submit; the agent did not submit. Therefore the agent fulfilled the user's request to draft the message and gather missing details.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Draft refund message (will not submit

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Include all required refund fields in the first message): I will use this. The shop requires order id, reason and amount at the top — I'll put those first (with placeholders if you haven't given them).
