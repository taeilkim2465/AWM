{"id": 529, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent provided a clear refund message draft that includes the required order ID, reason, and requested refund amount (with placeholders where the user must fill exact Order ID and amount). It also asked the correct follow-up questions (shipping/taxes inclusion, photos/evidence, whether to submit). The user requested not to submit; the agent did not submit. Therefore the agent fulfilled the user's request to draft the message and gather missing details.", "status": "success"}}
