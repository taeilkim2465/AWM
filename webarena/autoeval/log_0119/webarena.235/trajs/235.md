## Intent

Get the order number of my most recent under delivery order 

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for their most recent order with status "Under Delivery." The agent returned Order #000000189 but the page clearly shows its status is "Pending" and did not provide an "Under Delivery" order number or explicitly state that no such order exists; instead it asked a follow-up question. Because the requested information (the most recent "Under Delivery" order number) was not provided, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I found Order #000000189 on the order detail page (status: Pending, Order Date: May 2, 2023
