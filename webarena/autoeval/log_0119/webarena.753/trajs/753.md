## Intent

Create a private Android repository called "web_agent_android_xs" using the right template to speed up development.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to create a private Android repo named "web_agent_android_xs" from the Android template. The action history and final snapshot show the agent landed on the Android template page but did not perform the project-creation steps (no "Create project" confirmation, no project name entry, and no visibility set to private). Therefore the repository was not created as requested.  
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "file-creation checklist" — Useful later when adding files to the repo, but not needed right now for selecting a template. I will not use it at this step.
===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide this action:

===============INFO - Memory 1 (file-creation checklist): I will NOT use it right now — it's useful later when adding files to the repository, but at this step we only need to create the repo from a template.
