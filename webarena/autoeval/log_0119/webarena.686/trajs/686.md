## Intent

Promote auth0/angular-storage to subreddit technology with the description from the repo itself.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the URL, title, body and selected r/technology, then attempted to submit but the page shows the error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The agent correctly informed the user and prepared a subreddit-ready title/body, but the submission was not completed on the site. Therefore the requested promotion was not performed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I can’t complete the post right now because the site shows: \"You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.\" I prepared a subreddit-friendly title and body (adapted from the repo

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I'll adapt the repository description to the subreddit's preferred post style and prepare title/body/flair accordingly.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Format and metadata matter" — I will use this. It reminds me to adapt the repo description into a concise post and prepare the title/body/flair. That will help craft the final submission once the repo metadata is available.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories as guidance for how to format and where to post, but keep the user's instruction to use the repo's description verbatim (or as close as I can reproduce) and post to r/technology.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Format and metadata matter): I will use this — it justifies the concise title/body already filled from the repo and reminds me to include source attribution (which is present).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It's helpful to adapt the repo README into a concise subreddit-appropriate post and prepare metadata (title, body, link placement).

Wait a while before trying again.\" I prepared a subreddit-friendly title and body (adapted from the repo) you can use once posting is allowed. Also note you should check r/technology rules and required flair before submitting.\n\nSuggested title:\nauth0/angular-storage — AngularJS-friendly wrapper for localStorage & sessionStorage\n\nSuggested body:\nA small, AngularJS-friendly storage library that provides a consistent API around localStorage and sessionStorage, with fallbacks and utilities for safer client-side storage. Useful when you want simple, well-tested storage utilities integrated with AngularJS.\n\nKey points:\n- Angular-friendly API (services/directives)\n- Fallbacks when storage isn't available\n- Small and easy to integrate\n\nSource / repo: https://github.com/auth0/angular-storage\n\nRecommended next steps:\n- Confirm r/technology allows linking/promotional posts and whether a specific flair is required.\n- If you want, I can: (a) wait and try submitting again later; (b) try a different subreddit; (c) refine the title/body for a different audience; or (d) copy this content to your clipboard so you can post manually. Which would you like me to do?")
