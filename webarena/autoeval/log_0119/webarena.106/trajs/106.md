Action History:
1: send_msg_to_user("I can do that, but I need a couple quick clarifications:\n1) Should I search the GitHub repository umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel (not GitLab)?\n2) By “labels related to BUG# Reasoning Memories” do you mean issues labeled with any label containing \"bug\" (case-insensitive), a specific label named \"BUG#\", or labels containing the words \"Reasoning\" or \"Memories\"? Please specify the exact label(s) or the matching rule.\n3) Include only open issues or both open and closed?\n\nTell me how you'd like me to proceed and I’ll fetch the list using the repo’s label filter.")
