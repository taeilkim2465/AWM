## Intent

Thumbs down the top 3 post ever in books.

## RM

Thoughts: The page is sorted "Top – All time" and the first three posts each show a score of -1 with the down-arrow highlighted (blue), indicating they were downvoted. That matches the user's intent to thumbs-down the top 3 posts in /f/books, so the agent accomplished the task.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (top-N workflow): Use — this task is exactly "top-3 posts", so the systematic top-N approach will help ensure I find and process the top three posts reliably.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Follow a systematic top-N processing workflow) because it’s relevant: we should first enumerate the top-3 posts before downvoting them. Memory 2 and Memory 3 (single-book recommendation definitions) are not relevant to this downvoting task, so I will not use them.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (systematic top-N workflow): USE — it's directly applicable: I should enumerate the top-3 posts, then for each open and downvote them in order so none are missed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (systematic top-N workflow) is relevant and I will use it: I'll enumerate the top-3 posts in order, then downvote each one in turn to ensure none are missed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (systematic top-N workflow): I will use this — it's relevant because the task is to process the top-3 posts in order, so I should first enumerate the top posts for "All time" and then act on them.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (systematic top-N workflow): I will use this — it tells me to enumerate the top-N posts and act on each in order, which matches the user's request to downvote the top 3 posts.
