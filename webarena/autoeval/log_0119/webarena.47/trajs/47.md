## Intent

Today is 6/12/2023. Tell me how many fulfilled orders I have over the past month, and the total amount of money I spent.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent set the page to show 50 items, inspected the My Orders list, and used the correct 5/12/2023–6/12/2023 window. Visible orders in that range (e.g., 5/17/23) are Canceled or Pending, not "Complete." No "Complete" orders fall within the past-month window, so reporting 0 fulfilled orders and $0.00 spent (when counting only "Complete" as fulfilled) is correct. The agent also offered to recalculate with different status rules, which addresses ambiguity about "fulfilled." 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I checked your My Orders page (37 items shown, display set to 50 per page

===============INFO - Memory 1 (ranking metric) is not relevant for this task (we're looking for order counts and spending, not best-seller metrics), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 and Memory 3 because they remind me to verify the applied date range and to load all orders (pagination/scroll) before counting totals. Memory 1 (about ranking metric) is not relevant to this task.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1: yes — I should treat "fulfilled" as orders with status "Complete" (and confirm if the UI uses that status).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify ranking metric): Not relevant — this task is about counting fulfilled orders and summing spend over a date range, not about product ranking.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify ranking metric): Not relevant for this task — I will not use it.
