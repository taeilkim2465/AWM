{"id": 47, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent set the page to show 50 items, inspected the My Orders list, and used the correct 5/12/2023\u20136/12/2023 window. Visible orders in that range (e.g., 5/17/23) are Canceled or Pending, not \"Complete.\" No \"Complete\" orders fall within the past-month window, so reporting 0 fulfilled orders and $0.00 spent (when counting only \"Complete\" as fulfilled) is correct. The agent also offered to recalculate with different status rules, which addresses ambiguity about \"fulfilled.\"", "status": "success"}}
