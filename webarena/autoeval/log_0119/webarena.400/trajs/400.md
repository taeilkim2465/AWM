## Intent

Change my reddit bio to "Pro Python Developer with 20 years of Experience"

## RM

Thoughts: The biography text area and preview contain "Pro Python Developer with 20 years of Experience", the right-hand profile box shows the same text, and there is a green notification "The biography was updated." indicating the save succeeded. These confirm the bio was changed as requested.
Status: "success"
