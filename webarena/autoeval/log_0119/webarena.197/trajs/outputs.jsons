{"id": 197, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent returned a summed total ($807.40) from the Dashboard \"Last Orders\" widget and listed five per-order totals, but it did not verify that those five orders are non-cancelled or state that it confirmed their statuses. The user's intent explicitly required the last 5 non-cancelled orders; merely using the dashboard summary without confirming cancellation status is insufficient. The agent did offer to open each order to confirm, but did not perform that verification, so the information requested was not fully validated.", "status": "failure"}}
