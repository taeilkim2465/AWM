## Intent

Delete all pending reviews with less than 4 stars

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated into a single review (Edit Review page) that is Pending and shows a 3-star rating (which matches "pending reviews with less than 4 stars"), but there is no action in the history that clicks "Delete Review" or confirms deletion. Also the task asked to delete all such pending reviews; the agent only opened one review and did not iterate or perform deletions. Therefore the requested deletions were not performed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter to pending & negative): I will use this — it's directly relevant because we must locate only pending reviews with <4 stars before deleting.
===============INFO - Memory usage:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it? Yes. It recommends filtering to surface only pending & negative reviews. We're already on the "Pending Reviews" page, but there is no visible rating column in the grid — so we should inspect the individual review to verify its star rating before deleting.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter/search to surface only "pending" and "negative" reviews): I will use this — we should return to the reviews list and apply filters so we only select pending reviews with ratings < 4 before deleting.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The interface has a Status filter so I'll apply the "Pending" filter to surface only pending reviews first (this narrows results before I inspect ratings), as the memory suggests.
===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide my approach:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Filter or search to surface only "pending" and "negative" reviews): I will use this memory because it recommends filtering by status and sentiment before deleting. The page already shows the "Pending" status filter applied and "1 records found", so I should inspect the matching review(s) to check their rating before deletion.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter to pending + negative): Use — relevant. I will keep this filtering strategy in mind when returning to the reviews list so I only remove pending reviews with <4 stars and avoid deleting others.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): I will use the guidance to apply filters so I only target "Pending" reviews with low ratings before deleting — we should not delete indiscriminately.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter to pending/negative): I will use this — the list is already filtered to "Pending" (I can see "Pending" in the Status filter and "1 records found"), which matches the first part of the request. Memory 2 (confirm permissions/bulk-delete): I will use this — I need to confirm the review's rating before deleting and ensure the UI provides a delete action. Memory 3 (minimize navigation): I will NOT use this — we need to inspect the review details (rating) before deleting, so a bit of navigation (opening the review) is necessary.
