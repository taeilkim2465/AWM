{"id": 774, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent navigated into a single review (Edit Review page) that is Pending and shows a 3-star rating (which matches \"pending reviews with less than 4 stars\"), but there is no action in the history that clicks \"Delete Review\" or confirms deletion. Also the task asked to delete all such pending reviews; the agent only opened one review and did not iterate or perform deletions. Therefore the requested deletions were not performed.", "status": "failure"}}
