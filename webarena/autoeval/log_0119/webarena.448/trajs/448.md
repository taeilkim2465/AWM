## Intent

set the homepage URL on my GitLab profile to https://egg.tart.com

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to set the homepage URL to exactly "https://egg.tart.com". The action history shows the agent filled and saved the homepage as "https://egg.tart.com#Reasoning%20Memories" (i.e. with a fragment), and the agent's message confirms that saved value. The final page snapshot does not show the homepage field or a confirmation that the exact requested URL was set, and the saved value does not match the user's requested URL (extra fragment). Therefore the task did not meet the user's intent.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'm not going to use the memory items because they're about generating SSH clone commands and repository insights, which aren't relevant to changing a profile homepage URL.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (SSH clone URL formats): I will not use this — it's about forming SSH clone commands, not relevant to changing a profile homepage URL.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm the code-hosting platform before composing an SSH clone command): Not relevant — this task is about setting the website/homepage field on the profile, not about cloning via SSH.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It's about SSH clone URL formats and isn't relevant to changing the profile website URL.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it's about SSH clone URL formats; I will not use it for this profile update.
