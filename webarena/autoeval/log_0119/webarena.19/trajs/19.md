## Intent

Compare the time for walking and driving route from Carnegie Science Center to Carnegie Mellon University

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to compare walking and driving times. The final page shows only the driving route selected (Car (OSRM)) with Distance: 8.4 km and Time: 0:12. Although the action history includes selecting "Foot (OSRM)" at times, the final snapshot and directions only present the car result and no walking time or explicit statement that walking time is unavailable. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to provide both times (or explicitly state one is unavailable), so the task is not completed.
Status: failure

===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide the approach:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. It reminds me to present route details and caveats about variability; I'll include those after I collect both walking and driving times.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to run a routing query and note caveats (traffic, route choice). I'll use it after we get the driving result to explain uncertainty.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (compute driving distance/time with caveats): I will use this — it reminds me to note uncertainty and route factors when reporting times.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide this step.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to include caveats about variability when I report times, so I'll keep that in mind for the final comparison.
