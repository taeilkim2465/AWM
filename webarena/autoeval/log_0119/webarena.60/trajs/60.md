## Intent

Tell me the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Posner Hall

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the closest restaurant(s) to Posner Hall. The agent repeatedly retyped/queried the location but the page snapshot shows the search panel still loading (spinner) and no list of nearby restaurants or POIs is visible. The agent did not present the requested restaurant names/locations nor explicitly state that the information is unavailable. Therefore the information-seeking task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Anchor nearby searches to a precise place): I will use this. The search returned "No results found", so I should center the map/search on a precise, verifiable location (full address or city) to get correct nearby results.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they advise anchoring the nearby search to a precise, verifiable place and confirming the building's exact location before searching for nearby amenities. That will help the map center on Posner Hall so nearby restaurants are found correctly.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 3: first anchor the search to a clear, verifiable place (the campus) instead of the specific building because the earlier searches for "Posner Hall" returned no results. I will not use Memory 2 right now because this OpenStreetMap view doesn't provide a walking-mode routing interface for calculating pedestrian distances directly.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they advise anchoring nearby searches to a precise place and confirming the exact location (Posner Hall) before searching for nearby restaurants. I will not fully apply Memory 2 right now because the OpenStreetMap view I'm on may not provide a walking-route tool; I can locate nearby restaurants first and then look for walking/distance info if a directions feature is available.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide the search:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 to center the search on the exact building (Posner Hall) before looking for nearby restaurants. Memory 2 (using walking-mode directions) may be useful later to compute exact walking distances/times, so I will keep it in mind but not use it yet — first I need to get the precise location for Posner Hall.
