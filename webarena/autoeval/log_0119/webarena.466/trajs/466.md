===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify product details on the item page before adding to a list): I will use this — it's important to open the product page to confirm the exact item, SKU, and quantity options before adding to the wish list.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify product details) — I will use this. The search result shows the correct item, but the memory reminds me to open the product detail page to confirm attributes before adding to the wish list.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. The product detail page is already open and shows the authoritative info: "1 Pack (2 Roots) Hawaiian Bamboo Orchid..." so adding this product to the wish list will add the pack that contains 2 roots. I'll mention that to the user.
