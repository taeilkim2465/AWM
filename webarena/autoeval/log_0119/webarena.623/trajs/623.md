## Intent

Ask for advice about gift for birthday in a subreddit for relations

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted to post/ask for birthday-gift advice in a relationship subreddit. The agent only sent a set of clarification questions and did not draft or submit any post. The page snapshot shows the user's submissions list but no new post asking for gift advice or navigation to a relationship subreddit, so the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"
