## Intent

Compare the payment difference of the last 4 cancelled orders and completed orders

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task (compare payment differences for last 4 cancelled vs last 4 completed orders). The agent only cleared filters/clicked and then asked the user for confirmation to proceed (action 3); it did not open any orders, extract paid/grand-total amounts, or compute differences. The final page snapshot shows orders filtered to "Complete" but no gathered data or calculations are provided. Therefore the agent did not complete the requested task.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I will clear the current filters and then gather the 4 most recent cancelled orders and the 4 most recent completed orders (newest-to-oldest
