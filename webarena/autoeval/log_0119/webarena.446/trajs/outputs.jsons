{"id": 446, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked to assign the 404 issue to Roshanjossey. The action history ends on the issues list and the provided screenshot is the project issues list view (not an issue detail). There is no opened issue or assignee change visible (no Roshanjossey avatar/name shown next to any issue), and I see no confirmation that the assignee was set. The agent never appears to have opened the specific issue or the assignee control, so the assignment was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
