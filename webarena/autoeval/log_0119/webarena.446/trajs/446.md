## Intent

Assign the issue regarding 404 in a11yproject to Roshanjossey.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to assign the 404 issue to Roshanjossey. The action history ends on the issues list and the provided screenshot is the project issues list view (not an issue detail). There is no opened issue or assignee change visible (no Roshanjossey avatar/name shown next to any issue), and I see no confirmation that the assignee was set. The agent never appears to have opened the specific issue or the assignee control, so the assignment was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 and Memory 3 are both about including closed issues when searching by title — I will use these memories to remember to search across all issue states (open + closed) once I open the project's Issues page so I don't miss a closed issue that matches "404".
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 (they are the same guidance) to remind me to search across both open and closed issues for any issue mentioning "404" so we don't miss a closed match. I will not use Memory 2 because a specific project page is already open and I can navigate to the Issues list directly (no missing link or immediate permission question from the user).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Include closed issues when searching by title): Not needed — I'm already viewing the issues list and can see the relevant 404 issue, so I won't use this memory now.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Include closed issues when searching by title): I will use this — the issue may be open or closed, so I must search the project across all statuses or enable the "All" filter once in the project.
===============INFO - Memory 1 and Memory 3 (they're the same guidance) are relevant — I will use them: when searching for the issue by title I must include both open and closed issues or set the status filter to "All" so I don't miss a match. Memory 2 is not needed right now because the user referred to the project's issues directly and I have access to the repository UI; no missing link or permission prompt is required at this moment.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Include closed issues when searching by title): Not relevant — we are already on the specific issue page, so no search is needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It says to include closed issues when searching by title — that can help if the issue is closed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 and Memory 3 are identical and relevant: I will use them to make sure the issues search includes both open and closed results (so the 404 issue isn't missed). Memory 2 (prompt for missing links and posting permissions) is not needed because I already have the project open and can navigate to the issues list.
