## Intent

Open my latest created issue that has homepage content in its title to check if it is closed

## RM

Thoughts: The user's goal was to open their most recently created issue whose title contains "homepage content" and check its status. The agent executed a title search for in:title "homepage content", the page shows "We couldn't find any issues matching in:title 'homepage content'", and the agent only offered follow-up options instead of opening an issue. Since no issue page was opened and the requested check was not performed, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I searched for in:title \"homepage content\" but the search page reports no matching issues. Would you like me to: \n1

The user asked for the latest created issue with "homepage content" in its title regardless of open/closed status, so filtering to Open would be too restrictive.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (most recent open item via overview list): I will not use this. It assumes filtering to "Open" items, but the user only asked to open their latest created issue with "homepage content" in the title (status not restricted), so limiting to Open could miss the correct issue.
===============INFO - I'll consider the stored memories first:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter Open + sort by created desc): I will not use this — it would restrict results to Open only, but the user wants to check whether the latest-created matching issue is closed, so I must search across all statuses.
===============INFO - I will consider the three memory items:
