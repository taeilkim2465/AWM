## Intent

Thoughts: The agent only asked the user clarifying questions (which address types to update and whether to change recipient name/phone) and did not proceed to the account settings or perform any update.

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. The user didn't specify whether to update billing, shipping, or both, nor gave a recipient name/phone — Memory 1 says to confirm those before making changes to avoid incorrect edits.
