## Intent

Start a private project AGISite with JEKYLL template and add Rohan and Vinta as members

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot shows the AGISite project members page with only the creator (Byte Blaze) listed and an "Invite members" button visible. There's no evidence Rohan or Vinta were invited or added, nor any confirmation that the JEKYLL template was selected or the project visibility set to private. Therefore the user's full request (create private JEKYLL project and add Rohan and Vinta) was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories to guide the process.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Create a private project with a consistent field sequence): I will use this memory to ensure I fill the project name, set visibility to private, and follow the create/save flow. Use: yes.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories as guidance:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It reminds me to follow the standard creation sequence (name, set private, create) — useful after selecting the template.
===============INFO - We need to select the Pages/Jekyll template but previous clicks on the template radio (bid 498) kept timing out because a header / overlay intercepted pointer events. I'll use the stored memories:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the standard sequence when creating a new private project (enter name, set visibility to private, then create). I will use this memory — we already filled the name, now need to set visibility to Private and create.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it reminds me to confirm the project was created with private visibility before modifying members. The page shows "The project was successfully imported." and the heading indicates "Private", so the project exists and is private.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Create a private project..." — I will NOT use this now because the AGISite project already appears created (Activity shows "Created project Byte Blaze / AGISite"). The creation step is complete.
