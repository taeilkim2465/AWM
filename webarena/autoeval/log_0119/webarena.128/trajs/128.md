## Intent

What's the total number of items sold in the most recent 2 orders?

## RM

Thoughts: The dashboard screenshot shows "Last Orders" with Sarah Miller (Items = 5) and Grace Nguyen (Items = 4). The agent reported those two orders as 5 and 4 and summed them to 9, which matches the page. The response answers the user's information-seeking request correctly.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'The two most recent orders sold 5 and 4 items, for a total of 9 items. Would you like me to open the individual order detail pages to verify line items or export these orders?'

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — the Dashboard "Last Orders" table already shows item counts for recent orders, so I don't need the customers view.
