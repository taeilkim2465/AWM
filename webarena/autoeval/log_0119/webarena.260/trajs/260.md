## Intent

I want to browse the products in the Video Game category

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot shows the "Video Games" category page with the heading "Video Games", the navigation tab highlighted, and products listed ("Items 1-12 of 932"), indicating the agent successfully navigated to and opened the Video Games product listing. This satisfies the user's intent to browse products in that category.
Status: "success"
