## Intent

Among the top 10 post in "books" forum, show me the author name and the book name from posts that recommand a single book

## RM

Thoughts: The user requested author and book names from top-10 "books" forum posts that recommend a single book. The action history shows three clicks, but the final page snapshot only shows a header ("The Eliot–Hale Letters") and a mostly blank content area with no post list or extracted author/book info. No evidence the agent retrieved or returned the requested author and book names. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"
