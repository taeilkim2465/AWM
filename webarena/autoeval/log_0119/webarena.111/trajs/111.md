## Intent

Presents the monthly count of successful orders from Feb to Nov 2022 in MM:COUNT format

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot shows the Orders filters and an Export dialog (CSV selected) but no order counts or monthly breakdown are visible. The active purchase date range is 01/01/2022–11/30/2022 (includes January) and there is no displayed MM:COUNT list for Feb–Nov 2022. The agent did not present the requested monthly counts nor an explicit statement that the data was unavailable; merely opening the export dialog is not the same as delivering the requested information. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"
