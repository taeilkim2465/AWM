Thoughts: This was an information-seeking task. The OpenStreetMap search results in the snapshot clearly show Carnegie Mellon University with ZIP code 15213 (and the 407 South Craig Street result also lists 15213). The agent extracted and reported 15213 and offered a follow-up (full address or ZIP+4), so the user's intent was satisfied.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (use a specific authoritative address): Yes — the user asked for a zip code for an institution. I'll assume the main Carnegie Mellon University campus in Pittsburgh unless they tell me otherwise, and I'll state that assumption when I present the result.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a specific authoritative address when the user gives an institution — I will use this (assume the main Carnegie Mellon campus / central address).
