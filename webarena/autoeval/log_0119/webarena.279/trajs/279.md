## Intent

Provide me with the complete names of Bluetooth headphones from Sony, and also share the price range for the available models

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent was information-seeking (list complete Sony Bluetooth headphone names and give the price range). The action history only shows a search/filter and scrolling; there is no action extracting or returning the product names/prices. The final page image does show several Sony headphone names and prices, but the agent did not present those details to the user (and "complete" listing across the site would require more actions). Therefore the agent did not fulfill the information request. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 3 (they both instruct to compute price ranges from the raw visible listing prices) — yes, I will use them to extract numeric prices from the visible listings and compute min/max rather than relying on summary labels. I'll also use Memory 2 (verify product type and listing details) — yes, I'll apply it when we inspect the higher-priced listings to exclude bundles or unrelated items.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compute price ranges from raw visible listing prices): I will use this. It tells me to extract numeric prices from visible listings and compute min/max rather than trusting summaries.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items to guide extraction and validation:
