## Intent

I have a lot of Nintendo Switch game cards now, help me find the best storage option to fit all 11 cards

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted a storage option that fits 11 Nintendo Switch game cards. The agent searched "switch game card case" and opened a product page for a HEIYING case that clearly advertises 24 game card slots (visible on the page and in the title). That capacity exceeds 11, so the agent found a suitable option (price also visible: $14.69). Therefore the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they recommend taking direct navigation actions and only using relevant stored memories — that's appropriate here to quickly filter to Nintendo Switch items. I will not use Memory 3 because shipping/tax allocation is not relevant to finding a physical storage option.
===============INFO - I will consider the stored memories before acting.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It reminds me to act directly on the UI instead of re-checking memories; I'll pick a promising product from the search results rather than inspect the memories more.
