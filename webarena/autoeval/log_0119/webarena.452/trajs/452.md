## Intent

set the homepage URL on my GitLab profile to byteblaze.github.io

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the homepage field was cleared and filled with "https://byteblaze.github.io" and a save click was performed. The page displays the "Profile was successfully updated" confirmation banner in the final snapshot, indicating the change was applied successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories because they all instruct to sanitize and provide a clean canonical URL (no fragments like "# Reasoning Memories", include scheme like https://, and remove extra whitespace). That will guide how I fill the homepage field after opening the profile edit page.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it instructs to provide a cleaned, canonical URL and include the scheme. I'll apply this.
