## Intent

Change my reddit bio to "I am a robot"

## RM

Thoughts: The actions show the bio was filled with "I am a robot" and saved. The page preview and the profile box on the right both display "I am a robot," and there is a green toast saying "The biography was updated." These confirm the change was applied successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Verify posting permissions and authentication): Use — this is relevant to confirm I'm logged in and allowed to edit profile. I can see the account menu showing "MarvelsGrantMan136", so the session is authenticated.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 but not Memory 2.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It reminds me to confirm authentication and posting rules. The page already shows "Editing biography for /u/MarvelsGrantMan136", so I'm authenticated and allowed to edit the bio.
