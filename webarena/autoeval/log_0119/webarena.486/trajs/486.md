## Intent

Change the page title of "404 Not Found" page on my site to "Bruh bro you clicked the wrong page".

## RM

Thoughts: The Page Title field contains "Bruh bro you clicked the wrong page", the page heading shows that text, and there's a visible confirmation banner "You saved the page." The actions include filling the title and clicking Save. These indicate the 404 page title was successfully changed and saved.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Clarify which type of page or resource the user wants opened" — I will NOT use this memory because the user specifically said the "404 Not Found" page; in Magento that is the CMS "no-route" page so no further clarification is needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Clarify which type of page or resource the user wants opened" — I will NOT use this memory because the user already specified they want to change the 404 page title, and we are in the Magento admin UI where CMS pages are managed. No further clarification needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Clarify which type of page/resource): Not needed — the user already specified the 404 page and I'm already on the Pages admin listing, so I will not use this memory.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (clarify type of page): Not needed — the user already specified the site 404 page.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Clarify which type of page..." — Not needed. We're already on the Magento admin CMS page for the 404 page, so no further clarification required.
