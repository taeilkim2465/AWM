## Intent

I have jaw bruxism problem, show me something that could alleviate the problem.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for something to alleviate jaw bruxism (e.g., a night guard). The agent filled the search with "night guard" and clicked, but the final snapshot shows the site homepage product showcases (unrelated items) rather than search results or any night guard product or a statement that none are available. Because the requested information/products were not presented or confirmed unavailable, the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (scan visible review page first): Not useful right now — I haven't opened any product or review pages yet, I'm going to search for relevant products site-wide first.
