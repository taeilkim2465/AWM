## Intent

Find the resturants around CMU ArtPark Lab

## RM

Thoughts: The agent repeatedly filled the search box and clicked but the final page shows the global map with no search results, no list of nearby restaurants, and no markers around CMU ArtPark Lab. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to return the restaurants (or explicitly state none were found). Because no restaurant information was presented or indicated as unavailable, the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the page's search box to locate "CMU ArtPark Lab" and then search for nearby restaurants.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Validate and open the correct place card): Yes — I'll use this to confirm the correct CMU place when results appear rather than assuming the first match is correct.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It reminds me to open and validate the correct place card before assuming success—so I'll open the CMU search result and check it centers on the right campus area.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this — after finding candidate results I should inspect place details (address, distance) before assuming they're correct.
