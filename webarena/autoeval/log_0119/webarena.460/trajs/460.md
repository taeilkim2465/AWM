## Intent

Reduce the price of this product by 15%

## RM

Thoughts: The agent cleared the price field, filled it with 38.25, and clicked the save button. The page now shows Price $38.25. A 15% reduction means new_price = old_price * 0.85, and 38.25 / 0.85 = 45.00, so this corresponds to reducing a $45.00 price by 15% to $38.25. The requested change appears applied and saved.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Locate and update the correct price field safely): I will use this — I need to find the price input, clear it, and enter the calculated reduced price. I should pre-calculate the 15% reduction once I see the current price.
