{"id": 460, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent cleared the price field, filled it with 38.25, and clicked the save button. The page now shows Price $38.25. A 15% reduction means new_price = old_price * 0.85, and 38.25 / 0.85 = 45.00, so this corresponds to reducing a $45.00 price by 15% to $38.25. The requested change appears applied and saved.", "status": "success"}}
