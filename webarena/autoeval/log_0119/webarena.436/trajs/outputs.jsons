The agent did not open or restore any cancelled order or place a reorder \u2014 instead it navigated through pages and then asked clarifying questions (requesting the original order number or permission to search, and confirming a foundation item it found in the cart). The final page snapshot shows the shopping cart (with unrelated items) and no completed reorder. While the clarification questions are appropriate, the task (actually reordering the cancelled foundation) was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
