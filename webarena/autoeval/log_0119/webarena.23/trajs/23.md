## Intent

List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about good fingerprint resistant

## RM

Thoughts: The agent correctly identified and quoted reviewers who mention fingerprint resistance (Rachel and T. Gannon), stated no other reviewers on page 1 mention it, and offered to check page 2. The provided quote for Rachel matches the visible page snapshot; the response satisfies the information-seeking task requirements.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Reviewers who mention fingerprint resistance:\n\n1

===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2: they remind me to pair each reviewer name with the exact review excerpt to avoid misattribution — I will capture exact quotes alongside the reviewer names. I will not rely on Memory 3 right now because the visible reviews on this page already contain the full text for the entries I can see; however, I will still navigate to Page 2 to check remaining reviews in case there are additional mentions of fingerprint resistance.

It was kind of hard trying to get it on, and I did get some hairs on the sticky side, but all in all it was great! Bubbles went away around the small hairs so you can barely tell they are there. They also give you tons of extra tools to help you clean the screen and get dust particles off of the screen before you put it on. I think it was just me being clumsy with all of the dust particles getting inside the screen.\"\n\n2) T. Gannon — Posted on 4/18/23\n\"Nice product. Seems much better than the one replaced, it does seem to resist fingerprints and stay cleaner. This is noticeable especially for swipe entries as my finger glides much more easily in the screen. All else is good so far. I didn't do a great job putting it on, a few bubbles and dust specks. But it works so well I don't want to remove it.\"\n\nNo other reviewers on page 1 explicitly mention fingerprint resistance. Would you like me to check page 2 as well?")
