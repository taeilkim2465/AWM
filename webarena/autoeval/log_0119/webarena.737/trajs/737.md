## Intent

Show me the way from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of Philadelphia 76ers 

## RM

Thoughts: The agent correctly entered Carnegie Mellon University as origin and Wells Fargo Center as destination and repeatedly clicked the Go/directions controls, but the final map snapshot shows no route line or directions panel/results — just the map and the input box. Because the page did not display the route or step-by-step directions, the user's request to "show me the way" was not fulfilled.
Status: "failure"
