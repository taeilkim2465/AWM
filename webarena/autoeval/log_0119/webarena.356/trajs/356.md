## Intent

Show the route from SCS CMU in Pittsburgh to the location where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed

## RM

Thoughts: The origin (SCS CMU, Pittsburgh, PA) and destination (Independence Hall, 520 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia) are filled and the routing profile is set to "Foot (OSRM)", but the map does not show any route or directions overlay. The "Go" button is still visible in the sidebar, indicating the directions were not generated or displayed. Therefore the agent did not successfully show the route requested.
Status: "failure"
