## Intent

Draft an email to the shop owner via their contact us function for a coupon as I am a student

## RM

Thoughts: The contact form page is open and Name/Email fields are filled, but the message textarea only contains the signature ("Thank you, Emma Lopez...Phone: [your phone number]") — the actual student discount request text from the fill action is missing/was not entered. The Phone Number is also blank and there is no evidence the form was submitted. Because the required student discount request text was not present and the form wasn't sent, the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to keep the contact message concise, factual, and placeholder-ready (so the user can fill in personal/order specifics). I will not use Memory 3 since it's about refunds and not relevant to requesting a student coupon.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they recommend short, factual contact-message templates with placeholders (helpful for a student-coupon request). I will not use Memory 3 because it is about refunds and is not relevant to requesting a student coupon.
