## Intent

Gather the titles of Sony Computer Entertainment VR reviews with 2 stars and less rating from OneStopShop, and post them in the games subreddit under the title "real user feedback on Sony Computer Entertainment VR"

## RM

Thoughts: The user requested two things: collect titles of OneStopShop reviews for "Sony Computer Entertainment VR" with ratings of 2 stars or less, and post them to the games subreddit under the given title. The action history shows navigation through the product reviews and the final page snapshot displays at least one low-rated review titled "Received used items!!" but there's no evidence in the actions or final state that the agent extracted all review titles with 1–2 star ratings or performed any Reddit post. The agent's response content is not provided, and no posting action to Reddit appears in the history. Therefore the task was not completed as requested.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Infer dissatisfaction from review text when ratings are unavailable" — I will use this if the site doesn't display star ratings for some reviews, so I can still identify clearly negative reviews by their language.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. If star ratings aren't visible on a product's review list, I'll rely on negative language in titles/excerpts to identify 2-star-or-less feedback.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (infer dissatisfaction from text when ratings are unavailable): I will use this as a fallback in case some reviews don't show explicit star ratings — it will let me identify clearly negative reviews by strong negative wording. So: USE.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it helps infer negative reviews when star icons or explicit ratings are missing — useful if some reviews on the site lack visible star counts. I will not use Memory 2 (not relevant) or Memory 3 (formatting guidance not needed for extracting titles).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Infer dissatisfaction from review text when ratings are unavailable): Not needed — this page shows explicit rating percentages for each review, so I can identify 2-star and 1-star reviews directly.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Infer dissatisfaction from review text when ratings are unavailable): I will not use this — star ratings are visible on this page so I can rely on them directly.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (not needed — ratings are visible), Memory 2 (not relevant — there are reviews), or Memory 3 (not relevant to this task). The current page shows several low-rated reviews (40% and 20%) with their titles visible, but there are 12 reviews total and a "Page 2" link — I'll open page 2 to find any other reviews with 2 stars or less so I can collect all their titles before posting to Reddit.
