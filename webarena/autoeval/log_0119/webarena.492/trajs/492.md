## Intent

Notify Jane Doe in their most recent pending order with message "sorry we are out of stock, please reorder"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched orders for "Jane Doe" with the Status filter set to "Pending" and the final page clearly shows "We couldn't find any records" with active filters "Keyword: Jane Doe" and "Status: Pending". Instead of notifying a pending order, the agent informed the user that no pending orders were found and asked which next step to take (A/B/C/D). Because the user intent was to notify Jane Doe on their most recent pending order with the given message and the agent did not send that notification (it paused for further instruction), the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I found no pending orders for Jane Doe. Choose next step:\nA

===============INFO - I will use the memories about handling canceled orders (Memory 1, 2, 3) because they are relevant: if Jane Doe's most recent order is canceled we must not send a notification and should offer alternatives. Next I need to find Jane Doe's most recent pending order in the admin. From the Dashboard I should open the Sales section to view Orders and locate Jane Doe's orders (most recent, status Pending). I'll click "Sales" to proceed.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they guide how to handle canceled orders and what follow-up options to offer if the located order is canceled:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it tells me to treat canceled orders as terminal and offer next steps; that's important if the order we locate is canceled.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Treat canceled orders as terminal and offer next actions" — I will use this. It says not to try sending notifications for canceled orders and to offer alternatives; that's relevant if the located order turns out to be canceled.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Treat canceled orders as terminal and offer next actions): Not directly applicable right now because the search returned 0 records (no Pending order found). I will not apply its canceled-order rules yet, but I will keep its suggested next actions in mind if we find a Canceled order later. (Do not use.)
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they are relevant:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Treat canceled orders as terminal): Not applicable right now because the search results show 0 records; I won't attempt any action on canceled orders. I will not use this memory directly, but I will keep it in mind in case I locate a canceled order later.
