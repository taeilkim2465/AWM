## Intent

Create a discussion post about "long distance relationship" in a relevant subreddit and ask users for their opinions with the simple prompt, "your opinion"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the title ("Long-distance relationship") and body ("your opinion") and attempted to submit, but the page shows the error "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The submission was not created — the form remains filled and the site blocked the post. Although the agent informed the user and provided options, it did not complete the requested action of creating the discussion post.  
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I tried to create the post but the site shows: \"You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.\" The form is filled (Title: \"Long-distance relationship\", Body: \"your opinion\", Forum: relationship_advice

Wait a while before trying again.\" The form is filled (Title: \"Long-distance relationship\", Body: \"your opinion\", Forum: relationship_advice). What would you like me to do next? Options:\n1) Wait and retry posting later (I can retry periodically).\n2) Edit the title/body or add context before retrying — tell me changes.\n3) Try a different forum or cross-post to niche communities (tell me which, or I can suggest options).\n4) Copy the post text so you can post it manually elsewhere (I’ll give you the final text).\n5) Cancel.\nAlso tell me if you want to remain anonymous or include any extra context (how long together, timezones, main concerns) — this will help if we edit the post or choose target communities.")
