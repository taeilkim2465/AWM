## Intent

Where is the nearest In-N-Out to Upitts, and what is the walking distance to it?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the nearest In‑N‑Out to "Upitts" and walking distance. The agent only asked a clarification question (whether "Upitts" means University of Pittsburgh) and did not proceed to search, navigate, or compute distances. The final webpage snapshot is a generic OpenStreetMap view and contains no answered information. Because no information was retrieved or an explicit "not available" response was given, the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Do you mean the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA

===============INFO - I will use the memories about mapping and walking routing because they are directly relevant:
