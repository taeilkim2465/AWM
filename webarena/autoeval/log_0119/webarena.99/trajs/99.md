## Intent

Where is the nearest Five Guys to 5700 Penn Ave, and what is the walking distance to it?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the nearest Five Guys to 5700 Penn Ave and the walking distance. The agent did not provide that information — it only reported that the OpenStreetMap route was incorrect (949 km) and asked whether to search Google Maps or retry OSM searches. The final page snapshot still shows the incorrect long-distance route, so the agent has not resolved or given the requested location/distance. This meets the criteria for an information-seeking task failure.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "The OpenStreetMap route here shows 949 km (which is wrong — it matched a distant location

===============INFO - I will use the mapping/directions memories to ensure I find the actual walking route and distance, not just a straight-line result.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this memory later when I have the Five Guys location so I can request walking directions. (Will use later: Yes.)
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this memory (yes). I need to get a walking route from 5700 Penn Ave to candidate Five Guys locations to compute walking distance/time.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this (it directly applies).
===============INFO - I will use the mapping/directions memories because they recommend computing walking routes from the exact location and verifying closeness by actual walking distance — that is exactly what the user asked for.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this. The OpenStreetMap directions panel supports Foot (OSRM) and shows walking distances/times, so computing a walking route from the exact hotel/store to candidate Five Guys locations is appropriate.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this (yes). The page already has the directions widget and the mode set to Foot (OSRM), so I want to compute a correct walking route from the exact address to a Five Guys location.
===============INFO - I will use the memories about using a mapping/directions tool in walking mode and verifying distances by computing walking routes (Memory 1, 2, and 3). They all apply: I need to search for nearby Five Guys locations, request walking directions from the exact address (5700 Penn Ave / Whole Foods Market) to candidates, and then compare walking distances to pick the nearest.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use mapping/directions tool in walking mode) — I will use this. The page already has walking mode selected but the current route is 949 km (clearly the destination matched something far away). I should recompute walking directions with a clearer local destination name to get an accurate pedestrian route.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this (relevant).
