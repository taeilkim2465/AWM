===============INFO - Memory 1 (Create a private project sequence): I will not follow it exactly because it specifies creating a private project. I will reuse the general sequence (enter name, set visibility, create) but change visibility to public as the user requested.
===============INFO - Memory 1 describes creating a private project (set visibility to private). I will NOT use Memory 1 because the user asked for a public project.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Create a private project...) — I will not use this memory because it specifies creating a private project; the user requested a public project.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Create a private project sequence): Not relevant — the project is already created and is public, so I will not use this memory.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Create a private project) is not relevant — it describes creating a private project and we need a public project (and the project "web_arena" already exists in the current context).
