## Intent

Add a new size XXXL to green Minerva LumaTech V-Tee

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot shows the "Create Product Configurations" modal at Step 1 (Select Attributes) with Size and Color selected, but there is no indication the agent reached the Attribute Values step or edited the Size attribute to add an "XXXL" value for the green Minerva LumaTech V-Tee. The action history ends with repeated clicks on the attributes dialog and an Escape press; no action created or saved a new size value or updated the product. Therefore the requested content modification (adding size XXXL) was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Choose the next common size up" — Not relevant for this task (we're adding a specific size XXXL), so I will not use it.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the next common size up): I will not use this — it's about picking storage capacity, not relevant to adding a product size.
===============INFO - Memory 1 ("Choose the next common size up") is not relevant for this task — we're adding a specific size (XXXL), not choosing a capacity or size-by-count.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the next common size up) — Not relevant right now. This is about picking storage capacity; our task is to add a new size value (XXXL) for a product variant, so I will not use this memory item.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the next common size up): Not relevant — this task is about adding a specific size (XXXL), not choosing capacity alternatives.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Choose the next common size up): I will not use this — it's about choosing storage capacity and isn't relevant to adding a new clothing size.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Choose the next common size up (minimal extra capacity)" — Not relevant for this step. It's about choosing storage capacity and doesn't apply to adding a new product size.
