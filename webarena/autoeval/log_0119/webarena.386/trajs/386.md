## Intent

What is the rating of Ugreen lightning to 3.5mm cable. Please round to the nearest whole number

## RM

Thoughts: The user requested the product rating rounded to a whole number. The agent only performed a search and returned "65" without navigating to or showing a product detail page where a rating would be visible. The provided page snapshot is a search results page and does not display any rating or the claimed 65% value, so the agent did not demonstrably retrieve the requested information from the site. Therefore the task failed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'The listing shows a rating of 65%. Rounded to the nearest whole number: 65.'
