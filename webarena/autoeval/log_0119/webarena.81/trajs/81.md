## Intent

What is the duration required to first walk from Univ of Pittsburgh to starbucks on Craig Street, and then drive to Pittsburgh International Airport?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for durations for two legs (walk Univ of Pittsburgh → Starbucks on Craig St, then drive Starbucks → Pittsburgh Int'l). The action history shows many attempts toggling Foot/Car and refilling endpoints, but the final page only displays Starbucks → Pittsburgh International Airport with "Distance: 0m. Time: 0:00." and no walk route from University of Pittsburgh. No travel times for either leg (and the first leg is not shown), so the agent did not provide the requested information. Therefore the information-seeking task failed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories about using the page's routing tool and selecting walking mode for the first leg:
===============INFO - I'll use the page's routing tool to get realistic route times (Memory 1) — yes.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the map routing tool to get distance and driving-time estimates — I will use this (yes). It directly advises running the routing engine with clear origin/destination, which I need for the drive to the airport.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the map routing tool to get distance and driving-time estimates — I will use this (yes). The routing tool on the page is exactly what we need to get estimated times for each leg.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the map routing tool to get distance and driving-time estimates — I will use this (yes). It directly applies to getting the driving segment and the routing widget is already on the page.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use the page's routing tool to get real route times rather than estimating.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories:
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide the steps:
