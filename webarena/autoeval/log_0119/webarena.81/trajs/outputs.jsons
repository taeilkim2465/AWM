{"id": 81, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for durations for two legs (walk Univ of Pittsburgh \u2192 Starbucks on Craig St, then drive Starbucks \u2192 Pittsburgh Int'l). The action history shows many attempts toggling Foot/Car and refilling endpoints, but the final page only displays Starbucks \u2192 Pittsburgh International Airport with \"Distance: 0m. Time: 0:00.\" and no walk route from University of Pittsburgh. No travel times for either leg (and the first leg is not shown), so the agent did not provide the requested information. Therefore the information-seeking task failed.", "status": "failure"}}
