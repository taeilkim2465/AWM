## Intent

set the homepage URL on my GitLab profile to www.byteblaze.com

## RM

Thoughts: The action sequence fills the profile homepage field with "https://www.byteblaze.com" and clicks save. The page shows a "Profile was successfully updated" confirmation banner. Although the homepage field itself isn't visible in the current viewport, the success message indicates the profile changes were saved, so the homepage URL was set successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they all advise sanitizing profile URLs (remove fragments like '#' and ensure scheme). The user asked to set the homepage URL to "www.byteblaze.com# Reasoning Memories" which contains a trailing '#' and extra text — I should clean that to a canonical URL (add https:// and remove fragments/notes) before saving.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to enter a cleaned, canonical URL (include scheme, remove fragments). I'll follow it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It tells me to sanitize and provide a complete, valid profile URL (include scheme, remove fragments). This is relevant because the user-provided text contains a fragment and an inline comment.
