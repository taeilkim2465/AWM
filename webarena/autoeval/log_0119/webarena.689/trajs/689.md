## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it’s a refund template (keep body brief with refund placeholders), not relevant for requesting a coupon.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they recommend a short, factual, and professional message with contact placeholders — this fits a coupon request and speeds editing. I will not use Memory 3 because it focuses on refund messages that require placing order ID/amount at the top; that's not necessary for a simple coupon request.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to keep the body brief, factual, and include contact placeholders; I'll apply that to make the message concise and include placeholders for order ID and phone.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It recommends a brief, factual body with contact placeholders — that matches the user's request and keeps the message concise.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It recommends a brief, factual body and contact placeholders — that's helpful for keeping the message short and leaving placeholders for the user to customize.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it reminds me to keep the body brief, factual, and include contact placeholders. I'll follow that guidance.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to shape a short, polite message with contact placeholders so the shop can respond quickly. Memory 1 (brief body + contact placeholders) is directly useful — I'll include name, email, and a phone placeholder. Memory 2 (concise structure) is also helpful to keep the message professional and offer to provide order details if needed. Memory 3 (put required refund fields at top) is not relevant here because this is a coupon request, not a refund, and the contact form doesn't mandate those specific refund fields.
