## Intent

How many commits did kilian make to a11yproject on 3/1/2023?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task but the agent did not provide the requested count. The action history shows the agent filtered by author "Kilian" and then asked a clarifying question about date format and whether to count author vs committer, rather than giving the number or stating it is unavailable. Because the agent's final response is a clarification question and not the requested information, the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the memory items:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (validate page completeness and timestamp context) — I will use this. The commit list can be paginated or lazily loaded and times can be shown in a timezone; I'll ensure I load the section for Mar 1 and verify timestamps/authored vs committed if needed.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as follows before acting:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (validate pagination/timestamps) — use: Yes. I will ensure we filter by author and check the full list for that date (pagination may hide commits).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (validate page completeness & timestamps): I will use this — I need to ensure I check all pages/results and confirm the displayed timestamp context (timezones and whether it's authored vs committed).
