Who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked who gave 1 or 2 stars. The agent inspected the reviews and reported two 2-star reviewers (Evelyn Kurver and N Randall), explicitly stated there were no 1-star reviews on the current page, and offered to check page 2 for more — satisfying the information-seeking requirement by providing the requested names and next steps. The action history and agent message show the agent retrieved and reported the relevant information, so the task is complete.

Status: "success"

## Final Response "I found two 2-star reviews (no 1-star reviews on the current page

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not useful — it’s about organizing positive review themes, but the user asked to find who gave 1 or 2-star ratings for EYZUTAK phone cases (negative reviewers), so I will not use this memory.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not useful — it's about summarizing praise into categories, but the user asked who gave 1–2 star ratings, so I won't use it.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1, Memory 2, or Memory 3 because they are about grouping and summarizing positive praise and selecting representative quotes — the current task is to identify which reviewers gave 1- or 2-star ratings, so those memories aren't relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about organizing positive feedback into categories, not relevant to finding which reviewers gave 1 or 2 stars.
===============INFO - I will not use the stored memory items because they are about organizing positive review themes and picking representative quotes (Memory 1, 2, 3). The user's request is to identify who gave 1- or 2-star ratings, which requires reading reviewer names and ratings from the product's review pages, not organizing praise into categories.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not useful — it focuses on organizing positive praise into categories, but the user asked to find who gave 1 or 2 stars (negative reviews). I will not use Memory 1.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It's about organizing praise into categories; not relevant to finding which reviewers gave 1–2 star ratings.
