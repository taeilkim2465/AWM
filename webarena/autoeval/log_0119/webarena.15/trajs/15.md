## Intent

Tell me the the number of reviews that our store received by far that mention term "best"

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent applied a grid filter and reported "0 records found," but the screenshot shows the term "best" was entered into the SKU column, not into the review text/title/nickname fields where the user asked to search for mentions. The agent's message acknowledges it's reporting results "based on this search" and offers follow-ups, but it did not actually search the review content nor explicitly state that the requested information (count of reviews mentioning "best" anywhere in review fields) is unavailable. Because the search was applied to the wrong field and thus the user's request was not truly fulfilled, this execution is a failure.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I searched the Reviews grid for the term 'best' (using the grid filter

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the remembered approach to find reviews that contain the keyword: specifically, I'll open the Reviews UI and use the reviews grid filter to search for "best", then check multiple pages if needed and report the count.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide the search:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): It directly recommends using the reviews grid filter/search to find keyword matches — I'll use it to search for "best" in the reviews column.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. I used the reviews grid filter/search (as in Memory 1) to look for the keyword.
