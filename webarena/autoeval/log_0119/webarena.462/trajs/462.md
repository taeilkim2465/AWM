## Intent

Increase the price of this product by 10%

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only scrolled and sent a confirmation message showing the computed new price ($19.80) but did not change the price field or save the product. The action history and the page snapshot show no update to the price or any save action, so the requested content modification was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Current price: $18.00\nIncrease requested: 10% (+$1.80

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (pre-calc 15% reduction): I will NOT use this. It refers to a 15% reduction and pre-formatting for discounts; the user asked to increase the price by 10%, so that memory is not applicable.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Pre-calculate and format) — I will use this. Although Memory 1 mentions a 15% reduction, the general guidance to read the current price, compute the new price, and format it is exactly what we need; I'll adapt it to a 10% increase.
