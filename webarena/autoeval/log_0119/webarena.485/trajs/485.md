## Intent

Vinta wants to check my dotfile configurations. Please invite him to the repo as a guest.

## RM

Thoughts: The modal shows "Vinta Chen" in the username field and the role "Guest" selected, but the Invite button is greyed out (not clicked) and there is no confirmation that Vinta was actually invited. The action history does not include a successful click of the Invite button, so the invitation was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I'll assume the target repo is the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project shown on this page and that the host is this GitLab instance. I'll proceed, but will ask you to confirm if you meant a different repository or a different Git host.
===============INFO - I'll not use the memory items for this step because:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (clarify host/repo) because the page already shows the target project (dotfiles) on GitLab, so no clarification is needed. I will not use Memory 2 (SSH checks) or Memory 3 (commit-scope confirmation) because they are unrelated to inviting a user.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Clarify host/repo): Not needed — the page shows the GitLab project "dotfiles" so the target repo is already clear.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll first consider the saved memories:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Clarify host/repo..." — Not needed now. We already are on the correct GitLab project page and the invite modal is open, so I will not use this memory.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (clarify host/repo): I will not use this — we're already inside the GitLab project page (dotfiles) so no further clarification is needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — not needed here (we're already on the correct GitLab project page).
