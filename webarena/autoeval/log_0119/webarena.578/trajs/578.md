Action History:

Would you like me to: (1) retry the UI now/later, or (2) provide API/curl commands you can run to add the users? If you want the commands, here are templates you can use (replace placeholders):\n\n- Find project ID by path (or use numeric project ID):\n  curl --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: <YOUR_TOKEN>\" \"https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<URL-ENCODED-NAMESPACE%2FPROJECT>\"\n\n- Find user ID by username (example for yjlou):\n  curl --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: <YOUR_TOKEN>\" \"https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/users?username=yjlou\"\n\n- Add a user to a project as Reporter (access_level=20):\n  curl --request POST --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: <YOUR_TOKEN>\" \\\n    --data \"user_id=<USER_ID>&access_level=20\" \\\n    \"https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/members\"\n\nDo you want me to provide the exact commands filled in if you give me the project path or ID and confirm whether you will run them or want me to retry the web UI?')
