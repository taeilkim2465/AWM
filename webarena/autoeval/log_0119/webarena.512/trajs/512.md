## Intent

Add a toothpaste to my wish list.

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a green confirmation banner explicitly stating the toothpaste ("Baking Soda Whitening Toothpaste...") has been added to your Wish List, and the header/section shows "My Wish List 5 items" and "5 Item(s)". Those confirm the agent successfully added the toothpaste to the wish list.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide the steps:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Follow the action sequence): I will use this — it's best to open the product page first, then set options and add to wishlist.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It says to open product → choose options → add to wish list. I'm already on the product detail page, so the sequence is satisfied.
