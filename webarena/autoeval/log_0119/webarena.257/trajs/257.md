## Intent

What is the hours of operation of Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the store's hours. The action history shows searches on Nominatim but the final snapshot displays only the search box and a world map with no search results or business details visible (no hours listed). The agent did not return the hours nor explicitly state they were unavailable, so the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll NOT use Memory 1, Memory 2, or Memory 3 because they concern timezones and commit/order timestamps, which aren't relevant to finding a business's hours of operation.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it's about using a timezone shown on a page for commit timestamps. I will not use it for finding store hours.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use timezone on page) — not relevant to finding store hours, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - I'll check the memory items first:
