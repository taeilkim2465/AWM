## Intent

Show me the order date for order number 148.

## RM

Thoughts: The final page clearly displays "Order # 000000148" with "Status: Complete" and "Order Date: January 29, 2023." The agent's message exactly reported that order date, so the user's request was fulfilled.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Order #000000148 — Status: Complete — Order Date: January 29, 2023.'

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 for this step:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open and inspect order details): I will use this — the page already shows the full order record and line items, so I can confirm the exact order date from the order details.
