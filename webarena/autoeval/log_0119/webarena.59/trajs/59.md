## Intent

Tell me the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Hunt library

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the closest restaurant(s) to CMU Hunt Library. The agent performed several searches on the Nominatim page but the final snapshot shows the default Nominatim welcome/search page with a world map and no search results or list of restaurants. There is no evidence the agent located or returned any restaurant names, distances, or an explicit statement that no results exist. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to provide the restaurant information (or explicitly state none available), which it did not do. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Refine local-store searches with multiple phrasings): I will use this memory partly — it's useful to try clear phrasings if the first search doesn't return the right local place or nearby restaurants, but first I should anchor the map on the exact building. So I will keep this in mind if I need to re-query.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Refine local-store searches): I will use this. Trying multiple phrasings and including "restaurants near [place]" can surface local results when a direct place lookup fails.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Refine local-store searches with multiple phrasings): I will not iterate more phrasings right now — we've already tried several variations and should first ensure the current page link loads correctly instead of repeating searches.
