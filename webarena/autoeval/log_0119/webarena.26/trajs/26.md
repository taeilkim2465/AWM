## Intent

List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about complain of the customer service

## RM

Thoughts: The agent fulfilled the information-seeking intent by inspecting the reviews on the page and returning the reviewers who explicitly complained about customer service, including exact excerpts, reviewer names, and dates, and offered sensible next steps. The action history shows the agent accessed the reviews and then reported findings (no errors or missing required steps), and the page snapshot indicates the Reviews tab with 12 reviews consistent with the agent's claim. Therefore the task is successful.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I inspected the 12 reviews on this page and found 2 reviewers who explicitly complain about customer service:\n\n1

## Main Prompt

```md
User Intent: List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about complain of the customer service

Action History:
1: click('1851')
2: send_msg_to_user("I inspected the 12 reviews on this page and found 2 reviewers who explicitly complain about customer service:\n\n1) Reviewer: Bob in Vegas\n- Posted on: 4/20/23\n- Exact excerpt: \"Called customer service, and through very broken English was told there was no way to change their arbitrary 2-sided default other than to manually uncheck 2-sided printing in the printer dialogue box MANUALLY FOR EVERY SINGLE DOCUMENT YOU WANT TO PRINT.\" (also: \"Their poor excuse for customer service is only exceeded by the terrible design and poor quality of their products.\")\n- Mention: Explicit complaint about customer service quality and communication.\n\n2) Reviewer: RemyRRemyR\n- Posted on: 4/20/23\n- Exact excerpt: \"I went online looking for a customer support phone number; I couldn't find one. So I sent a facebook message to Epson explaining the issue... the person on the phone with customer service ... decided I'm eligible for a replacement under warranty. However, my printer arrived broken. They want to give me a refurbished one... Her technical support is CLEARLY not customer support ... 'it\\'s not like we can resell yours, it\\'s defective'.\" \n- Mention: Explicit complaint about customer support responsiveness, resolution (refurbished replacement), and tone.\n\nSummary/next steps: I looked at the 12 reviews on page 1 and found these 2 with explicit customer-service complaints. Would you like me to:\n- Check page 2 of reviews for more mentions, or\n- Search the site for keywords like \"customer service\", \"support\", \"customer support\", \"refurbished\", or\n- Export more review details (full text extracts for all matches)?\n")
