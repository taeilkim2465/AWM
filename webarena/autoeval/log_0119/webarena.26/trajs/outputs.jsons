{"id": 26, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent fulfilled the information-seeking intent by inspecting the reviews on the page and returning the reviewers who explicitly complained about customer service, including exact excerpts, reviewer names, and dates, and offered sensible next steps. The action history shows the agent accessed the reviews and then reported findings (no errors or missing required steps), and the page snapshot indicates the Reviews tab with 12 reviews consistent with the agent's claim. Therefore the task is successful.", "status": "success"}}
