{"id": 220, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for walking distances from nearby hotels to Gardner Steel Conference Center that take at most 5 minutes (information-seeking). The action history shows repeated searches and selection of \"Foot (OSRM)\" but no successful route/analysis was produced \u2014 the UI still shows origin as a specific hotel in Northbridge/Worcester County and the destination as Gardner Steel Conference Center with a \"Go\" button visible. The map only shows pins (one near Pittsburgh and one in Massachusetts) and no computed walking routes or travel times, and no list/filter of hotels within a 5-minute walk. Therefore the agent did not provide the requested distances or the filtered hotel list. Status: \"failure\"", "status": ""}}
