## Intent

Show me the walking distance from nearby hotels to Gardner Steel Conference Center, that take at most 5 minutes?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for walking distances from nearby hotels to Gardner Steel Conference Center that take at most 5 minutes (information-seeking). The action history shows repeated searches and selection of "Foot (OSRM)" but no successful route/analysis was produced — the UI still shows origin as a specific hotel in Northbridge/Worcester County and the destination as Gardner Steel Conference Center with a "Go" button visible. The map only shows pins (one near Pittsburgh and one in Massachusetts) and no computed walking routes or travel times, and no list/filter of hotels within a 5-minute walk. Therefore the agent did not provide the requested distances or the filtered hotel list. Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this (it’s necessary to get walking times/distances rather than straight-line).
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - I'll use the saved memories because they directly apply:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this. The OpenStreetMap page has a "Find directions between two points" link which should open a directions UI where I can set walking mode and compute pedestrian routes from candidate hotels to Gardner Steel.
===============INFO - I'll use the mapping/directions tool on this OpenStreetMap page in walking mode and then try to geocode nearby hotels and get walking routes to the Gardner Steel Conference Center so I can filter by <=5 minutes.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories:

===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — I should use the map's directions tool in walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances/times.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode — YES. I will use the map's walking (Foot/OSRM) routing to get accurate pedestrian distances and times.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — the mapping/directions tool in the page can compute walking routes; I'll use it to get walking distances/times.
