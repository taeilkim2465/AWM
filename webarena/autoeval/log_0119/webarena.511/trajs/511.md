## Intent

Add a laundry detergent to my wish list.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to add a laundry detergent to their wish list, but the agent only performed a search (filled the search box and clicked). The final page shows search results but no product was selected or added, and the wish list count still shows 4 items. Because no add-to-wishlist action occurred, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"
