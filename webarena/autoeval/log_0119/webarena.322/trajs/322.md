## Intent

How much refund I should expect from my order canlled in May 2023 if I cannot get the shipping fee refunded?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent opened the order page, read the order totals (Subtotal $350.42, Shipping & Handling $15.00, Grand Total $365.42) and correctly computed that if the $15 shipping is not refundable the refund equals the subtotal $350.42. The agent also noted reasonable assumptions (no taxes, discounts, restocking or other non‑refundable fees) and offered to check further — that is sufficient to answer the user's question from the page state shown.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "From the order details on the page: Subtotal = $350.42, Shipping & Handling = $15.00, Grand Total = $365.42. If the $15 shipping charge is not refundable, you should expect a refund of $350.42. Assumptions: there are no taxes, discounts, restocking or other non‑refundable fees shown on the order. If you want, I can check the order refund/adjustment details or suggest wording to request a shipping refund from support."

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to inspect the order line-item breakdown before calculating the refund, so I should open the specific order page.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories because they remind me to open the specific order page and inspect the line-item breakdown (items, shipping, taxes, discounts, and any fees) and to confirm whether shipping is refundable on that order page. That is necessary to compute the expected refund when shipping is non-refundable.
