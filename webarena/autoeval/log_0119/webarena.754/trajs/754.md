## Intent

Create a private NodeJS repository called "web_agent_nodejs" using the right template to speed up development.

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows "The project was successfully imported." The project name is web_agent_nodejs and a lock icon is visible next to the project name (private). The page also shows "Initialized from 'NodeJS Express' project template," confirming the correct template was used. These confirm the repository was created as requested.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'The repository import is in progress. I will wait a few seconds for it to finish and then check the page for completion.'

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Template-creation checklist): I will use this — it reminds me to enter the "create from template" flow, pick the correct template by label, set visibility to private, name the repo, and review before creating.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Template-creation checklist): Use — it's directly relevant. I'll follow its steps: confirm I'm in the "create from template" flow, choose the correct template label (Node.js), set visibility to private, enter the repository name, review and create.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Template-creation checklist) because it directly applies: I need to confirm I'm in the "create from template" flow and choose the correct template, set visibility to private, enter the repo name, and create. Memory 2 (file-creation checklist) is not needed at this step since we're only creating the repository from a template, not adding files. Memory 3 (confirm write access and branch context) is also not needed yet — I'll confirm permissions/branch later when editing or adding files.

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Template-creation checklist) because it directly applies: confirm we're in "create from template" flow (we are), pick correct template (NodeJS Express is already selected), set visibility to private, enter repository name, and create — following that checklist reduces mistakes.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Template-creation checklist): I will use it conceptually to confirm we followed the correct flow (create-from-template, private visibility, correct name). It’s relevant as a checklist to verify later, but the UI currently shows the "Import in progress" page so we can't act on the checklist right now — still, I will keep it in mind for final verification. (Use: yes, conceptually.)
