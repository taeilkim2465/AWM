===============INFO - Memory 1: "Find the most recent open item via the overview list" — I will NOT use this. It focuses on finding the most recent open item only, but the user asked for their latest created issue with "feature" in the title (not restricted to Open), so this memory is not the best fit.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter Open + sort by created) is not appropriate — the user asked for their latest created issue with "feature" in the title across statuses, not only Open items.
===============INFO - I will consult the past-memory items first.
===============INFO - I'll consider the three memory items before acting.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use?): No — it focuses on finding the most recent open item via the overview list; the user asked for their latest created issue with "feature" in its title (not necessarily "Open"), so this memory is not the best match.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 and Memory 3 but not Memory 1.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find the most recent open item via the overview list): I will not use this. It restricts to "Open" items and sorts by creation date, but the user wants their latest-created issue that has "feature" in the title and we need to check if it is closed (so we must search across all statuses).
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Find the most recent open item via the overview list" — I will not use this directly because the user asked for the latest created issue that has "feature" in its title (not necessarily the most recent open issue). Memory 1 focuses only on open items, so it's not the best fit.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find the most recent open item via the overview list): I will not use this. It restricts to Open items only, but the user asked to find the latest-created issue that has "feature" in its title and check whether it is closed, so I need to search across all statuses.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Find the most recent open item via the overview list" — I will NOT use this. The user asked for "my latest created issue that has feature in its title" regardless of open/closed, so restricting to "Open" would be wrong.
