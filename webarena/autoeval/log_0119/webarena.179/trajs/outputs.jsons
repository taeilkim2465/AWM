The agent did not confirm that #71 is the latest-created matching issue \u2014 it only inspected one issue and explicitly asked whether it should search all issues (open and closed) and sort by creation date to verify. Because the agent did not complete the verification step of finding the latest-created matching issue, the task is not finished.", "status": "failure"}}
