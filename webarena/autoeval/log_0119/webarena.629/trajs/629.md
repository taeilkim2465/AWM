## Intent

Create a discussion post about "Fun thing to do in Pittsburgh" in a relevant subreddit and ask users for their opinions with the simple prompt, "your opinion"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent correctly filled the Title ("Fun things to do in Pittsburgh") and Body ("your opinion") and attempted to submit, but the page shows a rate-limit/error message ("You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.") so the post was not created. The agent informed the user and offered next-step options, but the original task (actually creating the discussion post) was not completed.  
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I filled the post (Title: "Fun things to do in Pittsburgh", Body: "your opinion", Forum: pittsburgh

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide the post:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. It recommends a focused title and a minimal open-ended body; I'll apply that when filling the Title and Body fields (title: "Fun thing to do in Pittsburgh", body: "your opinion").
===============INFO - Memory 1 (focused title + short prompt): Use — this matches the user's request to keep the title concise and the body minimal to invite opinions.
===============INFO - I will reference the memory items as requested.
