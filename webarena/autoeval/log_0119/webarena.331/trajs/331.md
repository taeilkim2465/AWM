How much I spend in July 2022 on shopping at One Stop Market?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task (user asked for July 2022 spending). The agent only asked a clarifying question about whether to include taxes/shipping/discounts/refunds and did not provide the requested total or state that the information is unavailable. The visible order list in the final snapshot shows 2023 dates and does not show July 2022 totals, so the agent did not complete the user's request.
Status: "failure"
