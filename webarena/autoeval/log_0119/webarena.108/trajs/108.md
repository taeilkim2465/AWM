## Intent

Presents the monthly count of successful orders 01/2023-05/2023 in MM:COUNT format

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the purchase-date and status filters (active filters show 1/01/2023–5/31/2023 and Status: Complete) and the page shows "38 records found". The agent returned the monthly counts in MM:COUNT format (01:12, 02:07, 03:05, 04:09, 05:05) that sum to 38 and provided a brief summary and next-action options. This satisfies the user's request to present monthly successful-order counts for 01/2023–05/2023.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "01:12\n02:07\n03:05\n04:09\n05:05\n\nSummary: 38 complete orders found for 01/01/2023–05/31/2023.\nWould you like me to export the order details to CSV, include order IDs, or expand the date range?"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to verify the query results and prepare to aggregate/export counts once I reach the orders view. I will also use Memory 2 because when I present the monthly totals I should include a concise summary and offer follow-ups. I will NOT use Memory 3 (customers view) because the user asked for monthly order counts, which is best obtained from the Orders list rather than the customers list.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it reminds me to verify the query results after applying filters and to prepare for exporting/aggregating if the UI doesn't show monthly counts directly. I'll keep Memory 2 in mind for the final response format and next-step options. I will not use Memory 3 because customer-level order counts are not relevant—this task needs monthly counts of successful orders.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to apply filters, confirm results, and prepare to extract monthly counts after the query runs. I will not use Memory 3 right now (customer view) because the user asked for monthly order counts, which are best obtained from the Orders grid with date and status filters. I will keep Memory 2 in mind for the final response (brief summary + follow-ups), but I won't act on it in this step.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It reminds me to verify the query results after applying filters and to be ready to export or aggregate if needed. Right now I will apply the correct date range so the query can run; after results load I'll confirm counts (or export if the UI doesn't show monthly aggregation).
===============INFO - Memory 1: I'll use this. It recommends exporting the raw data (CSV) and aggregating by month if the UI doesn't provide counts directly — that's exactly what I need to do to produce MM:COUNT for Jan–May 2023.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1: YES — it explicitly advises exporting raw data if the UI doesn't provide the format and then aggregating by month. The Export dialog is open and CSV is selected, so exporting now will give the raw data I need to compute MM:COUNT.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. I used it to verify the query results are loaded (the UI shows "38 records found") and to prepare/confirm aggregation by month from the visible Purchase Date column.
