{"id": 75, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the optimal route visiting all three locations starting at MIT. The action history and final page show the directions only between Massachusetts Institute of Technology (green) and Logan International Airport (red) with distance/time (9.1 km, 0:15). Harvard University is not present on the final route or directions panel, so the agent did not compute or report a route that visits all three nor compare permutations to minimize total travel time. Therefore the task requirement was not satisfied.", "status": "failure"}}
