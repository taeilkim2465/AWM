## Intent

Show me the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with the style of Zoe products

## RM

Thoughts: The displayed review page is for product "Zoe Tank" showing a guest review (nickname "Valorie") with a 2-star summary/detailed rating and summary text, but there is no email address visible on the page. Also the detailed rating shown is generic "Rating" — there's no visible "Style" criterion to determine who is most unhappy specifically about style. Because the requested email is not present and the page doesn't confirm the "most unhappy with style" reviewer, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. I will explicitly define how I identify "most unhappy" (lowest rating, then strongest negative sentiment, then recency, then verified purchase). This helps justify the selection.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. I'll apply its guidance to be explicit about how I identify "most unhappy" before picking a reviewer.
