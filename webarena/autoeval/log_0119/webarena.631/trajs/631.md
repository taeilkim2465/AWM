## Intent

Ask for product recommendations for running shoes within a budget of $100 in r/sports

## RM

Thoughts: The user intended to post (create content) in r/sports requesting running-shoe recommendations — this is a content-modification task (submitting a post). The action history shows the agent navigated to the "Create submission" page, filled the title and body, and attempted to submit, but the final page clearly displays a rate-limit error ("You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again."), so the post was not created. Therefore the task (posting the request) was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "The site is rate-limiting submissions right now — the page shows “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again,” so I can’t successfully submit to r/sports at the moment.\n\nHow would you like to proceed? Options:\n1

===============INFO - Memory 1 (verify price on product page): Not using now — that's for after we get recommendations and check product listings.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Always verify price on the product page against the budget" — I will use the guidance from this memory in the content of the post by asking responders to confirm live prices and include links/sellers. I will not open any product pages on the site right now.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Always verify price on the product page against the budget" — I will not use this right now because I'm still preparing the Reddit submission (choosing the forum). Price verification is relevant later when gathering product links, not for filling the post.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Always verify price on the product page against the budget" — I will NOT use this memory right now because we're currently posting the request to r/sports asking for recommendations. Verifying prices will be relevant later when we gather and evaluate recommendations from replies or when I search product pages myself.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they matter for a price-constrained product-recommendation task:

Options:\n1) I can wait and try to post for you later when the site allows it.\n2) I can prepare a ready-to-paste post (title + body) and you can submit it when you’re able.\n3) I can skip posting and give you running-shoe recommendations here in chat right away (I’ll still verify live prices and include links and price + shipping notes).\n\nIf you want recommendations now, please confirm a couple details so I can verify prices accurately:\n- Your country/region or ZIP (for shipping/tax)?\n- Gender and shoe size (or approximate US size)?\n- Do you want strictly new shoes only, or are discounted/clearance items or gently used OK?\n- Any brand preferences or dislikes?\n\nI’ll apply budget filters and verify final prices (including shipping/tax where possible) before recommending models.")
