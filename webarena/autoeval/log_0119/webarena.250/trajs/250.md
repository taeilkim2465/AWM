## Intent

Tell me the coordinates of Apple Store near Pitt in DD format

## RM

Thoughts: The snapshot shows the OpenStreetMap share panel with a Geo URI reading "geo:40.45117,-79.93376?z=19" for the selected Apple Store (Walnut Street, Shadyside, Pittsburgh). The agent's reported decimal-degree coordinates (Latitude 40.45117, Longitude -79.93376) match the page; the user's request was to provide coordinates in DD and the agent did so. Therefore the task is successful.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use map share/Geo URI tools to get DD coordinates — I will use this (Yes). Once I locate the correct Apple Store on the map, the Share/Permalink feature is the most reliable way to extract decimal-degree coordinates.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they both recommend using the map application's Share/Permalink/Geo URI features to extract precise decimal-degree coordinates — that's the most reliable method here. I will not use Memory 3 because we already have a specific search result and don't need to confirm a separate origin location first.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it recommends extracting coordinates from the map's share/Geo URI (relevant).
