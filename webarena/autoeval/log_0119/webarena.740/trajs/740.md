## Intent

Show me the way from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of NYC NBA team 

## RM

Thoughts: The user requested directions (information-seeking). The agent correctly asked a necessary clarifying question (which stadium — MSG or Barclays? — and travel mode) and confirmed the assumed origin, but did not provide the requested route or state that the information is unavailable. For an information-seeking task the agent must return the directions (or explicitly say they can't), so the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a specific, confirmed origin point when computing driving distances — I will use this memory (yes). I'll assume Carnegie Mellon University's authoritative main campus address unless the user wants a different entrance.
