## Intent

I want to browse the products in the Cabinets, Racks & Shelves category

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows "Now Shopping by Category: Racks, Shelves & Drawers" and a product grid with "Items 37-72 of 117", indicating the agent successfully navigated to and loaded the Cabinets/Racks & Shelves category product listing. The action history matches applying that category filter. 
Status: "success"
