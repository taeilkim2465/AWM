## Intent

Set my gitlab status as Busy.

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent opened UI elements and entered "Busy", then clicked to save, but the final Projects page snapshot shows no visible status indicator (no "Busy" label or status emoji next to the user avatar/profile). Since there's no evidence the status was applied or displayed, the task of setting the GitLab status to Busy was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"
