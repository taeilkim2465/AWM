## Intent

Give me the SKU of the products that have 10 units left

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied a Quantity = 10 filter (actions show filling the quantity fields and applying filters) and reported "0 records found." The page snapshot confirms an active filter "Quantity: 10 - 10" and the message "We couldn't find any records." Therefore the agent correctly determined there are no products with exactly 10 units and clearly communicated that to the user.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I applied the Quantity = 10 filter and the product grid shows 0 records found, so there are no products with exactly 10 units left. Would you like me to broaden the quantity range or clear filters and search again?"

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prioritize listings that explicitly state capacity" — I will NOT use this. It’s about choosing listings that show capacity in the title/snippet; on the Magento admin I should use the product grid and filters (quantity) rather than relying on title snippets.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prioritize listings that explicitly state capacity" — I will not use this memory now because the product list is empty and we need to apply a filter to find items with quantity = 10 first.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prioritize listings that explicitly state capacity" — I will not use this memory. It's about product capacity in titles which doesn't apply to finding products with 10 units left in inventory.
===============INFO - I will use the page Filters to find products with quantity exactly 10 by setting Quantity from = 10 and to = 10, then applying the filters.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prioritize listings that explicitly state capacity" — I will not use this memory now because the product grid is already filtered by Quantity = 10 and shows results (or lack thereof); checking titles for capacity isn't necessary at this step.
