## Intent

Re-post the image of Bald Eagle in this page to earthporn subreddit and note "from /f/pics"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent did not create or cross-post the image to r/EarthPorn. Its last action was a message requesting the user log into Reddit and provide the post title and repost permission; no posting action or confirmation of subreddit rules check occurred. Therefore the task (re-posting the image) was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I can repost the Bald Eagle image to r/EarthPorn and include the note "from /f/pics". Before I proceed, please do the following so I can post: \n\n1
