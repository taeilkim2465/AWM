## Intent

What is the price range of teeth grinding mouth guard in the One Stop Market?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent performed the search, inspected the first page (items 1–12 of 4,944) and reported the observed price range ($7.99–$49.99) while explicitly stating the scope (current page) and offering to scan more results. That provides the requested price-range information with a clear limitation and an option to expand the search, so it meets the information-seeking requirement.
Status: "success"
