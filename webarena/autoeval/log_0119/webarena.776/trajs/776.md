## Intent

Delete all reviews from the scammer Carlo

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filtered reviews by nickname "Carlo" (fill('823','Carlo')) then chose the Delete action and applied it. The page shows a success message "A total of 2 record(s) have been deleted." and the grid (with the Carlo filter still applied) shows "We couldn't find any records" and "0 records found." These indicate the Carlo reviews were found and removed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I'll try to use filters or search to narrow reviews (by reviewer name, status or rating) so we only target Carlo's reviews and avoid accidental deletions.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It recommends using filters/search to narrow results — I'll apply that approach to find reviews by the reviewer name "Carlo" once I open the reviews list.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Filter or search to surface only "pending" and "negative" reviews): I will use this memory — the page has filter fields and I should use them to surface only reviews by the target nickname before deleting anything.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter to pending/negative): Not useful — the user asked to delete all reviews from "Carlo" and the page is already filtered by nickname Carlo, so I will not use this memory.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter/search for pending & negative): I will use this memory because it reminds me to narrow results before deleting. In this case I already filtered by nickname "Carlo" and the interface shows 2 records found and both are selected, so the filtering step has effectively been applied.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter for pending/negative): I will not use this — we already filtered by nickname "Carlo" and the two visible reviews match the target; no need to apply sentiment/status filters now.
