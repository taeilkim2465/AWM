===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prepare posting workflow and credentials..." — I will partially use this: I'll ensure I'm signed in and prepare the forum title/description/sidebar text before creating the forum.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prepare posting workflow and credentials): I will use this — it reminds me to have the forum name, description, and sidebar items ready before submitting. I already have those from the user's request (name: PlantsForCatParents; description: "Cat parents & plan lovers"; sidebar items list).
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prepare posting workflow and credentials before creating forum posts" — I will not use this now because the forum already appears created and we aren't making a new post; this memory is more relevant for posting content later.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prepare posting workflow and credentials before creating forum posts" — I will not use this memory now because it refers to preparing posts and credentials for posting content; we are creating the forum itself and the form is already filled.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prepare posting workflow and credentials before creating forum posts" — I will not use this memory now because we're creating a forum (not posting), and the page already shows the form filled and a saved confirmation.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prepare posting workflow and credentials before creating forum posts" — I will NOT use this memory now because we're not creating a post; we're creating/saving the forum and the form is already filled.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prepare posting workflow and credentials): Not needed — the forum has already been filled and saved, so we don't need to assemble or submit a post now.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prepare posting workflow and credentials): I will not use this now — the forum is already created and I don't need to prepare post credentials for this step.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prepare posting workflow and credentials): Not needed now — this task was about creating a forum, not posting inside it. I will not use this memory item for the next action.
