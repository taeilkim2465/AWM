## Intent

Add a new color blue to size S and M of Frankie Sweatshirt

## RM

Thoughts: The summary/confirmation page shows SKUs MH04-S-Blue and MH04-M-Blue listed with Size S and M and Color Blue (and the "Associated Products" section indicates the configuration products were created). This matches the user's intent to add the blue color for sizes S and M, so the modification was successful.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they are relevant:
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Select required variants/options before adding to the wish list" — USE. It's relevant because when adding new color variants we should ensure we pick the right size options (S and M) in the configuration process.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It reminds me to pick the exact attribute values (Size S and M, Color Blue) in the configurations flow so the new variants are created correctly.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Select required variants/options before adding to the wish list) — I will use this. It reminds me we must choose attribute values (Size and Color) in the configuration flow before creating variants, which is exactly what we need.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Select required variants/options before adding to the wish list): I will use this — it's directly relevant because I need to select the exact size and color values in the product configuration step before creating the new variants.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Select required variants/options before adding to the wish list): I will use this memory — it reminds me that variants (size and color) must already be selected before creating configurations. I confirm the dialog text says "Based on your selections 2 new products will be created," so the S and M + Blue selection appears to be set.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (select required variants) — USE: It's relevant to confirm that the S and M Blue variants are the ones being created; I see MH04-S-Blue and MH04-M-Blue in the Summary, so this is satisfied.
