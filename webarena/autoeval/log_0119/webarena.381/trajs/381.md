Find the hotel around Carnegie Music Hall

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task (find hotels near Carnegie Music Hall). The action history and final page show repeated searches (including by name, address, and coordinates) but the Search Results panel clearly states "No results found" and no hotel listings were returned or reported to the user. The agent therefore did not provide the requested information nor explicitly state that hotel info is unavailable from the site. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the saved memories because they all recommend the same useful approach: get a precise geolocation for Carnegie Music Hall and use that as the origin for a nearby-hotel search. The page already exposes a geo URI with coordinates (40.44331, -79.95131), so I'll anchor the search on that coordinate instead of a vague place name to improve results.
