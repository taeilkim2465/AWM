## Intent

Show me the email address of the customer who is the most unhappy with Circe fleece

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows the review by "Hannah Lim" with summary "Bad!" and the full review text, but there is no email address visible on this Edit Review page. The action history ends with scrolling and no action that reveals customer contact details (e.g., opening the customer record). Because the requested email was not shown or explicitly reported as unavailable, the agent did not complete the information-seeking task.
Status: "failure"
