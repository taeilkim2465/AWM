## Intent

yjlou wants to check my dotfile configurations. Please invite him to the repo as a guest.

## RM

Thoughts: The modal shows yjlou is added and the role is set to Guest, but the Invite button appears inactive/greyed and the dialog is still open in the final snapshot — there is no visible confirmation that an invitation was actually sent. Also another user (zane) was accidentally included in the invite list. Because the invite was not clearly submitted and an extra user was selected, the task was not completed as requested.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Always include brief SSH access checks and permission reminders" — Not needed for this step (inviting a user in the GitLab UI), so I will not use it now.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 (SSH checks) because inviting a user to the project is done via the project Members UI, not cloning. I will not use Memory 2 (clarify host/repo) because we are already on the correct project page (Byte Blaze / dotfiles). I will not use Memory 3 (SSH keys reminder) for the same reason.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use the open "Invite members" modal to add yjlou as a guest. Check memories:
