## Intent

Post my question, "safe and budge apartment to live in nyc", in a subreddit where I'm likely to get an answer

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot and page show the question was posted ("safe and budge apartment to live in nyc") but it appears under the "nyc" forum (/f/nyc) rather than r/NYCapartments which the agent had selected earlier. The user asked to post in a subreddit where they're likely to get an answer; the agent failed to place the post in the targeted/appropriate subreddit (it ended up in nyc), so the task's intent was not satisfied even though the post exists.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Choose a broad community..." — I will not act on this immediately (No). The user already asked where to post; I'll pick a high-visibility local community first, and can offer cross-posting afterwards if they want.
