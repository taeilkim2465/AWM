## Intent

Measure distance between Carnegie Mellon University and UPMC Shadyside by walking

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled origin/destination, selected Foot (OSRM), ran directions, and reported "Walking distance: 1.7 km. Estimated walking time: 22 minutes." The final page snapshot shows "Distance: 1.7km. Time: 0:22.", confirming the reported information is correct and available. This satisfies the information-seeking intent.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'I used the OpenStreetMap walking directions (origin and destination set exactly
