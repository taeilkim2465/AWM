## Intent

Compare the difference in time for walking and driving route from Randyland to Carnegie Mellon University

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for a time comparison between walking and driving routes. The action history shows the agent entered the two locations and repeatedly switched routing modes and clicked "Go", but the final page snapshot only shows the input panel and a zoomed-out map with markers — there are no route details or travel times displayed for either Foot or Car. Because the page does not show the durations (and the agent did not present them or state they were unavailable), the task did not produce the required information for comparison.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to run the routing queries and note caveats about variability (traffic, route choice). I'll use it when I report results.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it — it instructs to run a routing query for driving time and include caveats about variability. That applies to the driving step I'm about to run.
