Status: "failure"

Action History:
1: send_msg_to_user("I don’t know which host or owner you mean, so here are general SSH clone commands and notes. If you tell me the host (GitHub, GitLab, or a custom host) and the OWNER (user or org), I can give the exact URL.\n\nExamples (replace OWNER with the user/org name):\n- GitHub (scp-style):\n  git clone git@github.com:OWNER/metaseq.git\n- GitHub (ssh:// style):\n  git clone ssh://git@github.com/OWNER/metaseq.git\n- GitLab (scp-style):\n  git clone git@gitlab.com:OWNER/metaseq.git\n- Self-hosted (scp-style):\n  git clone git@HOST:OWNER/metaseq.git\n- Self-hosted (ssh:// style):\n  git clone ssh://git@HOST/OWNER/metaseq.git\n\nSSH key / access reminders:\n- Make sure you have an SSH key pair locally (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_ed25519) and the public key (~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub) is added to your account on the host.\n- Test your key: ssh -T git@github.com  (or ssh -T git@gitlab.com / ssh -T git@YOUR_HOST)\n- If the repo is private, ensure your account has permission to access it.\n\nTell me the host and OWNER (or give the repo URL) and I will provide the exact ssh clone command or copy the exact SSH clone URL for you.")
