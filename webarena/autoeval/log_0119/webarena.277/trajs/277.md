## Intent

Search for "batteries for iphone 13"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent performed the search actions and the final page shows "Search results for: 'batteries for iphone 13'" (items 1-12 of 36923). The agent informed the user that it found search results and offered sensible next actions (open a product, filter, sort, or scroll). This satisfies the user's request to search and appropriately asks a clarifying follow-up, so the task is successful.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I found search results for \"batteries for iphone 13.\" Would you like me to: 1

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Include the required capacity in the search query" — Not useful here. The user asked for "batteries for iphone 13", not a numeric capacity or slot count, so I will not use this memory.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Include the required capacity in the search query" — I will not use this memory now because the user only asked to search for "batteries for iphone 13" and we already have search results. The user didn't specify a capacity or count.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (include required capacity) — I will not use this now because the user didn't specify a capacity or item count.

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Include the required capacity in the search query" — I will not use this memory right now because the user only asked me to perform the search for "batteries for iphone 13" (which is already done). If you want a narrower search (e.g., a specific mAh), I can incorporate that next.
