## Intent

Add this product to my wishlist

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a green confirmation banner explicitly stating "Skinit Decal ... has been added to your Wish List" and the header indicates "My Wish List 10 items", matching the user's intent to add the product. The action click('1300') resulted in the expected confirmation and updated wishlist count, so the add-to-wishlist succeeded.
Status: "success"
