## Intent

Who else have access to my repo prism-theme, show me their usernames

## RM

Thoughts: The members list in the screenshot shows two accounts: Abishek S with username @abisubramanya27 and Byte Blaze with username @byteblaze (marked "It's you"). The agent's response lists @abisubramanya27 as the other user and correctly identifies the requester as @byteblaze (owner). This matches the page contents, so the agent fulfilled the user's request.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Other users with access to this repository:\n- @abisubramanya27\n(You are @byteblaze — owner.

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (look at the project's Members/Teams page for access rights) because the Members view is the authoritative place to see who has access. I will use Memory 2 (confirm repository is the primary source before trusting access lists) to verify the repo owner label once the project page is open so we don't report a fork's access. I will NOT use Memory 3 (contributors/insights) because commit/contributor lists don't reliably show repository access and the user asked specifically who has access.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — it reminded me to look at the project's Members/Teams (collaborators) page to determine who has access rather than relying on commit/contributor views.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use): Yes — it reminds me that the definitive place to see who has access is the project's Members/Teams view, so I'll navigate to Project information to find Members.
===============INFO - I will use the repository's Members view to get the definitive list of who has access (Memory 1) — that is the correct place to see collaborators/collaborators and teams. I also should confirm this is the canonical (owner) repository and not a fork before trusting the members list (Memory 2); I can verify ownership from the project header/breadcrumbs on the next page. I will not use Memory 3 because contributors/insights show commit counts, not access rights, and the user asked who has access.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. The memory recommends checking the project's Members view to determine who has access; that's exactly what I'm using.
