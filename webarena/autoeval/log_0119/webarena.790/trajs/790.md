Delete all negative reviews for Sybil running short

## RM

Thoughts: The agent never completed the delete operation. The history ends with selecting "Select All" and choosing the "Delete" bulk action but there is no click to apply/submit that action or confirm deletion. The visible page still shows 3 review records for "Sybil Running Short" (IDs 303, 302, etc.) and their checkboxes are unchecked/statuses are "Approved", so the agent also filtered status to "Pending" at one point which doesn't match the shown reviews. Because the reviews remain on the page and no apply/confirm step occurred, the negative reviews were not deleted.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the provided memories to guide how I find and remove negative reviews:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I'll apply filters/search to surface only the reviews that are pending/negative so I can delete just those.
===============INFO - Memory use:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The memory recommends applying explicit filters (status/sentiment) to surface only pending/negative reviews. I'll keep this in mind and use status filters if needed, but first I should inspect the existing filtered results for "Sybil running short" to see if any are negative before changing filters.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Filter to surface only "pending" and "negative" reviews): I will use this — it's directly relevant. I need to return to the reviews list so I can apply status and sentiment/rating filters to find only negative reviews for "Sybil Running Short" before deleting.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter/search for pending & negative): I will use this memory as a reminder to apply status or sentiment filters where possible — but the current list is already filtered to the product "Sybil running short". There is a Status filter available, but all visible reviews are "Approved", so filtering by status alone won't identify negative sentiment. I'll keep the filter option in mind if needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter/search to surface pending & negative): I will use this — it's important to narrow the review list so I can delete only negative reviews for "Sybil running short".
===============INFO - I'll consider the three memory items before taking action.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Filter or search to surface only 'pending' and 'negative' reviews" — I will use this. It guided earlier filtering; since current filters returned 0 records, I should clear/reset filters and re-run a broader search to include all statuses (not just Pending) so no reviews are missed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. It tells me to apply explicit filters (status/sentiment) or search to narrow results to the specific reviews before deleting; that's necessary to avoid deleting unrelated reviews.
