{"id": 790, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent never completed the delete operation. The history ends with selecting \"Select All\" and choosing the \"Delete\" bulk action but there is no click to apply/submit that action or confirm deletion. The visible page still shows 3 review records for \"Sybil Running Short\" (IDs 303, 302, etc.) and their checkboxes are unchecked/statuses are \"Approved\", so the agent also filtered status to \"Pending\" at one point which doesn't match the shown reviews. Because the reviews remain on the page and no apply/confirm step occurred, the negative reviews were not deleted.", "status": "failure"}}
