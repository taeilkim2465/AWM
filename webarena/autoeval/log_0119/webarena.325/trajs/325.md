Thoughts: The agent performed the search for "mouth night guard" (actions 1–2) and set the Sort By option to "Price" (action 3). The page snapshot shows "Sort By Price" with the sort direction indicator (down arrow) and results listed (Items 1–12 of 9819), matching the user's request to show listings by descending price. The agent's message confirms the top item is the highest-priced and offers sensible next steps — task achieved.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I checked the search results: Sort By is set to Price and items are already shown highest-price first (the top item is $28,283.99

===============INFO - I will search the site for "mouth night guard" and then sort results by price descending.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Sort by price high-to-low): Use — it's directly relevant. The page already has "Price" selected and the top items show very high prices, so descending price is already applied.
