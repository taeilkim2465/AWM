## Intent

I am arriving at Carnegie Mellon University. Find the nearby US Citizenship and Immigration Services and the walking distance to the nearest Social Security Administration from US Citizenship and Immigration Services

## RM

Thoughts: The OpenStreetMap snapshot and directions panel show a green marker near Carnegie Mellon and a red marker downtown labeled a Social Security Administration location; the Directions box lists Distance: 5.7 km and Time: 1:15 for foot travel. The agent's message correctly reports the nearby US Citizenship and Immigration Services location (green marker) and the walking distance/time to the nearest SSA (about 5.7 km, ~1h15m), so it fulfilled the user's request and offered reasonable next steps.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items to guide how I search and what I report:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3: I should assume the user's reference is Carnegie Mellon University's main campus and will state that assumption so the user can confirm or correct it. I will also use Memory 2 later to confirm official addresses for any candidate facilities I find (so I won't present final addresses/distances until I verify them).
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items:
===============INFO - Memory review:

===============INFO - Memory 1 (state assumption about campus): I will use this — I assumed "Carnegie Mellon University" means the main Pittsburgh campus; I'll state that assumption so you can confirm or correct it.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this — I must state any assumption about which campus/location I'm using. I'll assume you mean the main Carnegie Mellon University campus in Pittsburgh unless you tell me otherwise.

The walking route on the map from that US Citizenship and Immigration Services location to the nearest Social Security Administration (listed on the map as the Penn Avenue / Cultural District SSA, ZIP 15222) is about 5.7 km and takes roughly 1 hour 15 minutes on foot. \n\nWould you like me to: \n- Confirm the official postal addresses for both offices (I can open their authoritative listings)? \n- Get driving or public-transit times instead of walking? \n- Find a closer SSA office if one exists that the map didn’t choose?")
