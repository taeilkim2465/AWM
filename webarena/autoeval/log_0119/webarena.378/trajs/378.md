## Intent

Find the parking around CMU main campus

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to find parking around CMU main campus (information-seeking). The action history shows repeated search attempts on Nominatim for "parking near Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" but the final page snapshot shows a generic world map and no search results, no parking locations, and no explanatory message that parking data is unavailable. Because the agent did not return the requested parking information (or explicitly state it could not be found), the task was not completed successfully.
Status: failure

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. I should be explicit that I'm assuming "Carnegie Mellon University main campus in Pittsburgh, PA (ZIP 15213)" as the anchor for nearby parking; I'll state that to the user and ask them to correct me if they meant a different campus.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. The user asked for "CMU main campus" so I should state I'm assuming Carnegie Mellon University's main campus in Pittsburgh, PA (and offer to change if they meant another campus).
