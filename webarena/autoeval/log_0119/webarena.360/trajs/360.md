## Intent

Show me the product names for order number 148.

## RM

Thoughts: This was an information-seeking task (product names for Order #000000148). The agent navigated to the order page and provided the product names verbatim; the first listed name matches the visible item on the final page and no error messages are shown. The response supplies the requested information and offers a sensible follow-up, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Order #000000148 — Product names (verbatim as displayed

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (report full product names exactly as shown) so I copy titles verbatim from the order details. I'll also use Memory 2 (locate the exact order before asking specifics) — I need to open the account/orders area and find order #148 to verify its line items. I will not use Memory 3 (treat the most recent completed order as authoritative) because the user requested a specific order number (148), not the most recent order.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (report product titles exactly as listed) to ensure I return the exact product names, and Memory 2 (locate the exact order before confirming details) to first open the specific order record. I will not use Memory 3 because it refers to the most recent completed order and the user asked for order number 148 specifically.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (report full product names exactly as shown): I will use this so the product titles I return match the listing verbatim.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 and not use Memory 3.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Report full product names as shown in listings): I will use this — it tells me to capture the product titles exactly as displayed, including variant descriptors, which is required for accuracy.
