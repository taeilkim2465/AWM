## Intent

List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about ear cups being small

## RM

Thoughts: The agent returned four reviewer names and quotes, but the page snapshot only shows reviewers Jenna Kaufman, Joseph Brzezinski, and another (unnamed in the visible area) whose text includes "Also they really are for people with very small ears." The names the agent listed (Dibbins, Catso, Anglebert Dinkherhump, Michelle Davis) do not appear in the visible reviews and at least one quoted line ("These are NOT over the ear cups...") doesn't match the visible content. Because the agent's extracted reviewer list and attributions do not match the page snapshot and there is no evidence all cited reviewers exist on the page, the task was not performed correctly.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Reviewers who mention the ear cups are small:\n\n- Dibbins — \"The ear cups MAY be ok for children ... for adult sized ears they are way too small\"\n- Catso — \"Also they really are for people with very small ears\"\n- Anglebert Dinkherhump — \"These are NOT over the ear cups. I got about half my ear into it and the rest is on top so for long listening it may hurt the ears.\"\n- Michelle Davis — \"For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won’t go over mine as I’m an adult with adult sized ears\""

## Captions

===============INFO - I need to open the product reviews and scan them for any reviewers who mention the ear cups being small. I'll click the "12 Reviews" link to jump to the reviews section, then read the reviews to find those comments.
===============INFO - I read the Customer Reviews section on the product page and looked for mentions of ear cups being small. I found four reviewers who explicitly mention ear-cup/ear-fit size. I'll report their names with a short excerpt from each review.
