## Intent

Draft a refund message via their "contact us" form for the PS3 remote controller I bought early 2023. It broke after three days of use. The shop requires the order id, the reason and the amount to refund in the message. Don't submit yet

## RM

Thoughts: The agent created a refund message that includes the required fields (Order ID placeholder, reason describing the controller failure after three days, and requested refund amount placeholder) and did not submit the form, matching the user's "don't submit yet" instruction. The draft also offers supporting details (photos/serial number) and asks about shipping/taxes, which is appropriate. Therefore the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Order ID: [INSERT ORDER ID]\nReason: PS3 remote controller stopped working after three days of normal use.\nRequested refund amount: $[INSERT AMOUNT]\n\nHello,\n\nI purchased a PS3 remote controller in early 2023 (Order ID above

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they all emphasize placing the required refund fields (order ID, reason, refund amount) at the top of the message — which is exactly what the shop requires and what the user asked for.
