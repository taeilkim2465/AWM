## Intent

Show me the "iphone 12 phone case" listings by price.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent performed the search for "iphone 12 phone case", selected the "Price" sort option, and the final page snapshot shows "Sort By Price" with search results (Items 1-12 of 43033) — indicating the listings are displayed sorted by price. This matches the user's request to show listings by price, so the navigation was successful.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories as follows:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3: they recommend switching the Sort By option to Price and (if needed) toggling the sort direction to show highest prices first. I will not use Memory 2 yet — I'll collect visible prices after the sort to compute any range if you want that.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Sort by price high-to-low): I will not use this memory because the page already has "Sort By: Price" selected and the visible top results are very expensive items — it's likely currently sorted high-to-low. The user didn't specify high-to-low specifically, so I should confirm or show the more typical low-to-high ordering.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they recommend sorting by price and toggling to descending so the highest-priced items appear first. I will not use Memory 2 yet (compute price range) — I'll wait until the page is sorted and visible listings are updated, then I can extract prices if needed.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Sort by price high-to-low): I will use this — it directly tells me to set the price sort to descending to surface highest-priced items.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 and Memory 3 are directly relevant: they recommend switching the sort direction to descending to surface highest-priced items. I will use both. Memory 2 (compute price range from visible listing prices) is not needed right now because the user only asked to show the listings by price (i.e., sort by price); we don't need to calculate ranges yet.
