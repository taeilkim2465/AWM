## Intent

Tell me the name of the customer who has the most cancellations in the history

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the customer with the most cancellations (an information-seeking, aggregate result). The action history and final screenshot only show navigation through the Orders grid and an open export dialog; there is no evidence the agent computed or reported an aggregate count by customer or returned the requested name. The visible page shows individual orders (one Canceled row for Adam Garcia) but that alone does not determine "most cancellations" across the full history (308 records). Because the agent did not provide the requested aggregated answer or explicitly state it was unavailable, the task failed.

Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm non-cancelled status before selecting 'last N' orders" — I will not use this memory. It advises excluding cancelled orders when assembling a list of non-cancelled orders; here we specifically need cancelled orders, so that guidance is not applicable.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm non-cancelled status before selecting 'last N' orders" — I will NOT use this memory right now. The user asked for the customer with the most cancellations (we need canceled orders), so this memory about excluding cancelled orders is not relevant.
===============INFO - I will decide which memory items are relevant before acting.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 (treat canceled orders as terminal) because counting cancellations requires recognizing cancelled orders explicitly. Memories 1 and 3 are about filtering non-cancelled recent orders and selecting latest non-cancelled orders — those are not needed for this task, so I will not use them.
===============INFO - Memory check:

===============INFO - I'll use the admin orders export so I can get a full CSV of all orders and count cancellations per customer accurately.
===============INFO - I will use the remembered guidance before taking any UI action.
