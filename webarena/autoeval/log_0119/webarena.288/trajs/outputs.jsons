{"id": 288, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the customer with the most cancellations (an information-seeking, aggregate result). The action history and final screenshot only show navigation through the Orders grid and an open export dialog; there is no evidence the agent computed or reported an aggregate count by customer or returned the requested name. The visible page shows individual orders (one Canceled row for Adam Garcia) but that alone does not determine \"most cancellations\" across the full history (308 records). Because the agent did not provide the requested aggregated answer or explicitly state it was unavailable, the task failed.", "status": "failure"}}
