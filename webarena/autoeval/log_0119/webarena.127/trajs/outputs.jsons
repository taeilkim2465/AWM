{"id": 127, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked which brands appear most frequently among the top search terms (an information-seeking task). The provided webpage snapshot is the Magento dashboard and does not show any \"Top Search Terms\" list or any entries mentioning \"hollister\" (or other brands), so there is no visible evidence to support the agent's claim. For an information task the agent must return the actual data or explicitly say the data is not available; instead it asserted a specific result without supporting evidence from the page. Therefore the execution is not successful.", "status": "failure"}}
