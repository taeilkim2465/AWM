## Intent

Add the following users to my GitHub timeline item management extension as maintainer: ['abisubramanya27', 'lahwaacz']

## RM

Thoughts: The only recorded action is a single click and the final screenshot shows the projects list page, not a project settings or members page. There is no evidence the agent navigated to the extension repository, opened its Members/Settings, or added the two usernames as maintainers. Therefore the requested modification was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm repository write access and branch context before editing): I will use this — before changing project settings or adding members I should confirm I have permission for the project. Memory 2 (Proactively offer follow-up options): I will not use this now — it's about post-addition follow-ups, not needed until after I add the users. Memory 3 (File-creation checklist): I will not use this — we're modifying project members, not creating files.
