{"id": 32, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent searched for and selected \"Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport (South Robinson Mall)\" (actions 13 & 17) and routed on foot to \"Giant Eagle Market District, Commons...\" (actions 18\u201319). The final OpenStreetMap directions panel shows Distance: 2.4 km, Time: 0:33, so the walking distance from the hotel to the Giant Eagle is about 2.4 km (\u224833 minutes). Giant Eagle is a regional supermarket chain headquartered near Pittsburgh, so it reasonably qualifies as a local company. This satisfies the user's request for a Hilton hotel name and the walking distance to a nearby locally\u2011owned supermarket.", "status": "success"}}
