## Intent

I will arrive Pittsburgh Airport soon. Provide the name of a Hilton hotel in the vicinity, if available. Then, tell me the the walking distance to the nearest supermarket own by a local company from the hotel.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for and selected "Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport (South Robinson Mall)" (actions 13 & 17) and routed on foot to "Giant Eagle Market District, Commons..." (actions 18–19). The final OpenStreetMap directions panel shows Distance: 2.4 km, Time: 0:33, so the walking distance from the hotel to the Giant Eagle is about 2.4 km (≈33 minutes). Giant Eagle is a regional supermarket chain headquartered near Pittsburgh, so it reasonably qualifies as a local company. This satisfies the user's request for a Hilton hotel name and the walking distance to a nearby locally‑owned supermarket. 
Status: "success"
