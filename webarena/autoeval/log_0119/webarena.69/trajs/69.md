===============INFO - Memory 1 (single-book recommendation): I will not use this—it's about identifying single-book recommendations, which is not needed yet (we're searching for posts about supporting local bookstores).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (single-book recommendation): I will not use this — it’s about detecting single-book recommendations, which is unrelated to finding posts about supporting local bookstores.
===============INFO - I'll consider the memory items first:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (single-book recommendation) — not relevant to this task, so I will not use it.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 (follow a systematic top-N processing workflow) because the user asked about the top 10 posts and I should enumerate and inspect them in order. Memories 1 and 3 (about single-book recommendations) are not relevant to this task, so I will not use them.
===============INFO - Memory 1-3 are about detecting single-book recommendations and a top-N processing workflow. They are not relevant to this task (the user asked about posts supporting local bookstores and organizations involved), so I will not use those memories.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories to make this search systematic.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (single-book recommendation) is not relevant to this task — I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "single-book recommendation" — Not needed here (user asked about supporting local bookstores and organizations, not single-book recs). I'll not use Memory 1.
