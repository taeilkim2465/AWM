## Intent

Fill the "contact us" form in the site for a refund on the remote controller I bought, stating that it broke after just three days of use. Also, ensure to include the order number #180 and the product SKU. Don't submit yet, I will check.

## RM

Thoughts: This is a content-modification task (filling the Contact Us form). The agent populated name, email, phone, and the message field and did not submit (as the user requested). The message correctly states the remote broke after three days and includes Order #180. However the product SKU was left as a placeholder ([PRODUCT SKU]/[INSERT SKU]) rather than an actual SKU value, so the user's request to "include the order number #180 and the product SKU" is not fully satisfied. Because the SKU was not provided/inserted, the task is incomplete.

Status: "failure"
