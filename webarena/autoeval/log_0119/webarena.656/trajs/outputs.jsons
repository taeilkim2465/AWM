The agent populated name, email, phone, and the message field and did not submit (as the user requested). The message correctly states the remote broke after three days and includes Order #180. However the product SKU was left as a placeholder ([PRODUCT SKU]/[INSERT SKU]) rather than an actual SKU value, so the user's request to \"include the order number #180 and the product SKU\" is not fully satisfied. Because the SKU was not provided/inserted, the task is incomplete.", "status": "failure"}}
