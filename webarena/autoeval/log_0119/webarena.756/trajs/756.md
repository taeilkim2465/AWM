## Intent

Create a private JEKYLL repository called "11711_gitlab" using the right template to speed up development.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to create a private JEKYLL repo named "11711_gitlab" using the template. The action history and final snapshot show the agent landed on an existing "jekyll" example project page (not a newly created repo named 11711_gitlab) and there is no indication a new repository was created or that privacy was set to private. Therefore the required creation and privacy/template steps were not completed.
Status: "failure"
