## Intent

Tell me the coordinates of Western Pennsylvania Hospital Heliport in DD format

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched OpenStreetMap, opened the Share panel for the Western Pennsylvania Hospital Heliport, and the Geo URI shown on the page is "geo:40.46102,-79.94595?z=17". The agent reported those decimal-degree coordinates (Latitude 40.46102, Longitude -79.94595), which directly answers the user's request. The page snapshot confirms the Geo URI with those coordinates, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use map share/Geo URI tools to get DD coordinates" — I will use this memory later if the OpenStreetMap place page provides a share link or Geo URI with coordinates, so: USE.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use map share/Geo URI tools to get DD coordinates): I will use this. The page's "Share" feature often provides a permalink or Geo URI that includes precise decimal-degree coordinates, which is the most reliable way to get DD values.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use map share/Geo URI tools to get DD coordinates): I will use this memory if the map or share panel returns a geo: or share link with coordinates for the heliport. It's relevant, so I plan to keep it in mind.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use map share/Geo URI tools to get DD coordinates): I will use this memory if I can get a share/geo URI that contains precise DD coordinates. Right now the share panel shows an example geo URI (42.896, -74.553) which is not the heliport; so I will try a more targeted search first. I intend to use Memory 1 after finding the correct place on a map service.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use map share/Geo URI tools) is useful — I'll try to get coordinates from the map/share features once I locate the hospital/heliport. I will use it.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1: yes — the page's Share / Geo URI gives DD coordinates directly and is the most reliable source if the map is centered on the heliport. Memory 2: no — we don't need to lock an origin location for a nearby search. Memory 3: no — we already have a place result; instead of re-running the same search, I should check the "More results" list to see if the heliport appears as a separate entry.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use map share/Geo URI tools to get DD coordinates — I will use this (yes). The OpenStreetMap share panel on the page includes a Geo URI that normally gives precise decimal-degree coordinates.
