## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for estimated driving time from New York City to the city known for authentic Philly cheesesteaks (Philadelphia). The action history shows the agent routed from "City of New York, New York" to "Philadelphia Museum of Art" and the page snapshot displays "Distance: 154km. Time: 2:02." The agent's message states about 2 hours 2 minutes (154 km ≈ 96 miles) and notes it's an estimate — this directly answers the info-seeking request. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response "The routed driving time shown is about 2 hours 2 minutes (Distance: 154 km ≈ 96 miles
