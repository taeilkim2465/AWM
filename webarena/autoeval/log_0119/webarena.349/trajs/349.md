## Intent

Who else have access to my repo gimmiethat.space, show me their usernames

## RM

Thoughts: The Members page in the screenshot shows two accounts with access: "Byte Blaze" (it's you) with handle @byteblaze, and "yjlou" with handle @yjlou. The agent reported the other member as yjlou — @yjlou and noted your account — @byteblaze, which matches the page contents, so the information-seeking task was satisfied.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Other member with access: yjlou — username: @yjlou\n(You are listed as Byte Blaze — @byteblaze.

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I will confirm I'm looking at the primary repository (owner/fork status) once I open the project page so the access list is authoritative.
===============INFO - I will review the available memory items and decide whether to use them for finding who has access to the repository.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It refers to contributors/insights for commit counts; the user asked who has access (members), so contributors data isn't required.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It recommends the contributors/insights view; unnecessary because I'm already on the project's Members page which directly lists who has access.
