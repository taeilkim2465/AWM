## Intent

Lookup orders that are processing

## RM

Thoughts: The filter "Status: Processing" is active (shown under Active filters) and the table shows orders with Status = "Processing" and "5 records found", so the agent successfully located processing orders.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the saved memories to guide the search and ensure accuracy:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it recommends finding the latest processing order by opening the orders list then the order detail. I will follow that approach.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Locate the latest processing order by navigating orders list then details" — I will not use this yet as a first step because we first need to find all orders with status "Processing" in the orders overview before picking a specific one.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 because it explicitly instructs to apply the status filter and sort by date to find orders with a specific status — that matches the current task.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide this step.
