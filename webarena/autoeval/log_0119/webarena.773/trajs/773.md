## Intent

Delete all pending negative reviews

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a yellow message "A total of 2 record(s) have been deleted." but the grid still lists "1 records found" and displays a remaining review (ID 349) with a clearly negative snippet ("I'm not impressed..."). Since at least one pending negative review remains, the agent did not delete all pending negative reviews.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter/search to surface only "pending" and "negative" reviews): I will use this — I need to narrow the reviews to only pending + negative before deleting to avoid removing anything else.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because I need to surface only "pending" and "negative" reviews before deleting — I'll look for filters or search on the Pending Reviews page to narrow to negative/pending. I will use Memory 2 to confirm I have the necessary permissions and to check whether bulk-delete exists (and to abort if no matching reviews are found). I will also keep Memory 3 in mind to report back context (e.g., any positive/neutral reviews found and next-step options) after I inspect the results, but I won't pause the deletion flow for that unless you want a summary first.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it recommends filtering to pending + negative. We're already on the Pending Reviews grid, but there is no explicit sentiment filter visible, so I will manually select the reviews that are clearly negative (IDs 353 "Bad!" and 351 "won't recommand").
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1: yes — it advised to use filters/search to surface only pending + negative reviews. The current page already shows "Pending Reviews" and the rows include sentiment clues (titles "Bad!" and "won't recommand") and two checkboxes are already selected. So the interface appears to be showing the pending reviews and the likely negative ones are selected.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (filter for pending + negative): I will use this memory as a reminder that we should only delete the reviews that match both "pending" and "negative". The current grid shows 3 pending reviews and 2 are already selected (IDs 353 and 351) which appear to be the negative ones, so the selection already matches the intended scope.
