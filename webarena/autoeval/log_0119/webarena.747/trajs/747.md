## Intent

Start a private project awesome_web_agents with blank template and add Abishek, Vinta as members

## RM

Thoughts: The project "awesome_web_agents" appears to have been created (project page and invite members modal are visible), but the invite modal's username/email field is empty so Abishek and Vinta were not added. The visibility (private) and template (blank) settings are not evidenced in the final snapshot. Because the members were not actually added and privacy/template are not confirmed, the task is not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use the web UI (not the API fallback) to create the project and then add members using the invite/autocomplete workflow.
===============INFO - Memory usage:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - We need to (1) set the project visibility to Private, (2) create the project, then later add members. I'll explicitly consider the saved memories first and decide whether to use them.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - We need to add members to the existing project. The UI for the project is visible (activity page), so we should use the web UI member-invite flow rather than the API fallback.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Fallback to API): I will not use this. The web UI is available and I should try the built-in Members UI first.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (API fallback): I will not use this — the web UI is accessible, so no need for API fallbacks.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (API fallback): Not using — the web UI is available and we should use the invite workflow.
