{"id": 638, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user wanted a post made in the most appropriate subreddit asking for must-have products under $30. The agent only asked follow-up questions and then clicked, landing on a generic \"Create submission\" form (forum dropdown still set to \"Choose one...\" and Title/Body empty) \u2014 no subreddit/forum was selected, no title or body was filled, and no submission was created. Also the page appears to be a different forum (Postmill) rather than Reddit. Therefore the task was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
