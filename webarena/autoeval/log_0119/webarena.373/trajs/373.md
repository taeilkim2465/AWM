## Intent

Pull up the description page of Whole Foods near Carnegie Mellon on Map

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows search results for "Whole Foods Pittsburgh" (two matching Whole Foods locations) but no specific place description page was opened and no result was selected. The user asked for the description page of the Whole Foods near Carnegie Mellon, which the agent did not navigate to or display. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"
