{"id": 22, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "I inspected the Customer Reviews shown in the final page snapshot (Reviews tab). The visible reviews (e.g., \"Gorgeous pictures, high quality product\" by AZ Guy and the \"Poor Construction\" review) mention use at the beach, lake, rain, etc., but do not explicitly mention taking underwater photos. No reviewer in the displayed content explicitly mentions \"under water\" or underwater photography. Therefore there are no reviewers on the shown page who mention underwater photos.", "status": "success"}}
