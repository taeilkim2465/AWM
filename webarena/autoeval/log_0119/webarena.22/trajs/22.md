## Intent

List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about under water photo

## RM

Thoughts: I inspected the Customer Reviews shown in the final page snapshot (Reviews tab). The visible reviews (e.g., "Gorgeous pictures, high quality product" by AZ Guy and the "Poor Construction" review) mention use at the beach, lake, rain, etc., but do not explicitly mention taking underwater photos. No reviewer in the displayed content explicitly mentions "under water" or underwater photography. Therefore there are no reviewers on the shown page who mention underwater photos.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I'll use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Capture reviewer name and text together): I will use this. I must pair any review text I find that mentions underwater/photo with the correct reviewer name to avoid misattribution.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will ensure any matching quote is paired with the correct reviewer name and excerpt to avoid misattribution.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (pair name + text): I will use this — it's important to record each reviewer name together with their exact review text to avoid misattribution.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (pair reviewer name and text): I will use this — when I find relevant reviews I'll capture the reviewer name together with the exact excerpt to avoid misattribution.

===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (capture reviewer name and text together) because I need to report reviewer names alongside the exact review text so quotes aren't misattributed.
