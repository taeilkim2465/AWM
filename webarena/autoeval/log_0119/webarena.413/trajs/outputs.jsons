{"id": 413, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user wanted the repository LICENSE replaced with a copyleft license (GPL v3). Although the agent filled a commit message and uploaded gpl-3.0.txt, the final page still displays the original MIT license text in the LICENSE file, the commit area shows \"0 changed files\" and the \"Create commit...\" button is disabled. That indicates the new license was not saved or committed. Therefore the requested change was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
