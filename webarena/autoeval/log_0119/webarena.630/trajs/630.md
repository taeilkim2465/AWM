Ask for product recommendations for noise-cancelling headphones within a budget of $200 in r/headphones

Thoughts: The agent reached the Create submission page and filled the title and body for an r/headphones post, but was blocked from submitting by the site's error message "You cannot post more.

3: fill('142', 'Hi r/headphones — I am looking for noise-cancelling headphones that cost no more than $200 (including tax/shipping). I primarily want strong active noise cancellation, good sound quality for music, and a comfortable over-ear design for long listening sessions. I prefer wireless but am open to wired options if the value is good. Any specific models, recent deals, or tips for getting the best ANC under $200? Thanks!')

10: send_msg_to_user("I filled your r/headphones post, but the site shows “You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again,” so I can’t submit it right now. I plan to use the memories as follows: (1) I will verify live prices on product pages before recommending (Memory 1). (2) I’ll apply price filters early when searching to limit candidates to ≤ $200 (Memory 2). (3) I’ll only ask one quick clarifying question if needed (Memory 3). How would you like to proceed? Options: \n\nA) Wait and I’ll try to submit the post later when posting is allowed. \nB) I provide product recommendations here now (I’ll search, filter by price, verify live prices, and give brief pros/cons). \nC) I prepare a refined post/draft for you to copy and submit later. \n\nIf B, do you want immediate recommendations now? Any additional constraints (brand dislikes, target usage like travel/commute/office, battery-life minimum, or strictly wireless only)?")
