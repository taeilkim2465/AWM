## Intent

Show me the path and travel time from home of the 1980 Super Bowl champions to home of the 1991 Super Bowl champions.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only asked a clarification and did not enter origin/destination or compute a route/time. The final page snapshot shows the OpenStreetMap directions form still empty and no route or travel time displayed. Because the agent did not provide the path or travel time (and did not complete the navigation action), the task is incomplete.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Quick clarification: do you mean the teams that won the Super Bowl for the 1980 and 1991 seasons, or the teams that won the Super Bowl games played in the calendar years 1980 and 1991? Also, should I use each team’s home stadium/location at the time they won, or their current home stadium/city? If you don’t care, I’ll default to the team’s home stadium/location at the time they won and compute a fastest-route, ideal-traffic driving time using the map tool."

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. I need to state routing/traffic assumptions (whether estimate includes real-time traffic and which route/service I use).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (state route/traffic assumptions) — yes, I should state whether the travel time includes traffic and which route/tool I use.
