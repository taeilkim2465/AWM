{"id": 14, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent reported \"0\" reviews, but the action history and final page show the search term was entered into the Nickname filter (the screenshot shows \"not useful\" in the Nickname column) while the Review field is empty. The user asked for reviews that mention the term in reviews (not nicknames), so the agent did not search the correct field and therefore cannot reliably answer the user's intent. The response should have searched the Review column (or searched all fields) before concluding 0.", "status": "failure"}}
