## Intent

Tell me the the number of reviews that our store received by far that mention term "not useful"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent reported "0" reviews, but the action history and final page show the search term was entered into the Nickname filter (the screenshot shows "not useful" in the Nickname column) while the Review field is empty. The user asked for reviews that mention the term in reviews (not nicknames), so the agent did not search the correct field and therefore cannot reliably answer the user's intent. The response should have searched the Review column (or searched all fields) before concluding 0.  
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I searched the reviews grid for the term \"not useful\" and found 0 reviews that mention it. The grid shows “We couldn’t find any records.”\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Reset the filter and try variant searches (e.g., \"not useful\" with different casing or partial words like \"useful\"

===============INFO - We have to find how many store reviews mention the exact term "not useful". I'll use the stored memories to guide the approach:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use the reviews grid filter) because it's the direct, recommended method to find how many reviews contain the keyword "not useful". I will also keep Memory 2 in mind so I can report clear findings and offer follow-ups after we get the results. Memory 3 (scan the visible review page first) is useful if the reviews page shows a small list, but first I need to open the reviews grid to see the page and available filters.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use the reviews grid filter) because the grid has a filter row and applying a keyword there is the most direct way to get a count of matching reviews. I will also use Memory 2 (report findings and follow-ups) to summarize results and suggest next steps after the filter is applied. I will not use Memory 3 (manually scan the visible page first) because using the grid filter will search across all records and give an accurate count more efficiently.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I used the reviews grid filter to search for the keyword "not useful" (matches the approach described).
