## Intent

Presents the monthly count of successful orders from Jan to December 2022 in MM:COUNT format

## RM

Thoughts: The agent did not present the monthly counts for Jan–Dec 2022. Instead it asked a clarification about which status to treat as "successful" and the final page snapshot shows orders filtered to 01/01/2023–05/31/2023 with Status: Complete (wrong year and incomplete range). No MM:COUNT output was produced and the required 2022 data was not retrieved. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Before I pull counts: which order status should I count as \"successful\"? Examples: Complete, Processing, or another status?"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it tells me to present results in MM:COUNT format and offer follow-up options — that matches the user's requested output and next steps.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It tells me to format the final output as MM:COUNT, include a one-line total summary, and offer follow-up options — I'll follow that when presenting the monthly counts.
