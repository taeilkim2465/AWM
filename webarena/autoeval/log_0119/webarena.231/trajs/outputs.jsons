{"id": 231, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for their most recent cancelled order number. The agent only performed one click and the final page snapshot shows the \"My Account\" overview (contact info, address book) with no orders list or any cancelled order/order number visible. The agent's reply gives a specific order number/date but there's no evidence on the displayed page that this information was retrieved (the agent did not navigate to \"My Orders\" or show the order details). For an information-seeking task the agent must present the requested info from the site or state it's unavailable; here the claimed order number is unsupported by the page state, so the execution is not successful.", "status": "failure"}}
