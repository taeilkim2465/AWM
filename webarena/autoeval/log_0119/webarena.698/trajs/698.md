## Intent

Add a simple product named Lelelumon Yoga Mat with 42 in stock, available in size uni-size and color black, priced at $769.99

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a confirmation "You saved the product." and the action log includes filling name, SKU, price, and quantity, so the product was created and saved. However there are no actions that set the requested attributes for size ("uni-size") or color ("black"); no fills or selections for those attributes appear in the history and the final page does not show them. Because the user's intent explicitly required the product to be available in size uni-size and color black, the task requirements were not fully met.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant to creating a new product (it's about inspecting competitor listings). I will not use it now.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using. It concerns inspecting existing marketplace listings for bundle/price details — irrelevant to creating a new product in the admin.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this memory to remind myself to enter the price as a per-unit price (USD) and ensure the product is a single item (not a bundle) when creating the listing.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it's about inspecting competitive-swimwear listings and price normalization, which doesn't apply to adding this product.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it's about comparing listings on external sites, not needed for adding a product here.

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about inspecting listings for price/unit comparisons, not relevant to adding product attributes.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not relevant — it's about inspecting competitor listings/prices, which doesn't apply when creating a product. I will not use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not needed — that memory is about checking competing listings and bundle/pack pricing on marketplace search results, which doesn't apply to filling a single Magento product form.
