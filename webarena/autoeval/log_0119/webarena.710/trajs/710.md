## Intent

Create a shipping report from 08/05/2022 to 03/01/2023

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the From and To fields with the requested dates (the screenshot shows From = 8/5/22 and To = 3/1/23), but there is no visible report output on the page (the Show Report button is still present and no results table or report content appears). That indicates the report was not actually generated or the final click did not produce the report. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the Reports workflow and date filters to generate order reports — I will use this. It directly describes navigating to Reports → Orders/appropriate report and setting From/To dates, which is exactly what's needed for the shipping report.
