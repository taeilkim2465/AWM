## Intent

Checkout merge requests assigned to me

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows the "Assignee = Byte Blaze" filter and lists three open merge requests ("Add verification functions", "update or remove 404 links", "feat: add WCAG levels"), so the agent successfully navigated to and displayed the merge requests assigned to the user.
Status: "success"
