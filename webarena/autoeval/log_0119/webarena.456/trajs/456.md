## Intent

Disable Cora Pant from the site, they are facing some quality issues.

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the product edit for "Cora Parachute Pant" with a success banner "You saved the product." and the "Enable Product" toggle set to "No" (disabled). This matches the user's intent to disable the Cora Pant, so the agent achieved the intended change and saved it.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm core product) is relevant and I will use it — before disabling I must ensure I act on the main configurable/product record, not just a variant.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm core product) — I will use this. Before disabling anything I must confirm I'm acting on the main/configurable product record rather than a variant or accessory to avoid unintended impact.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm core product) — I'll use this. The product in the list is "Cora Parachute Pant" and its Type column shows "Configurable Product", so I need to confirm I'm editing the parent/configurable product (not a simple child variant) before making changes.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I should confirm I'm acting on the core product record. The page shows "Cora Parachute Pant" (SKU WP04) and has a Configurations section listing child variants, so this is the configurable (parent) product. I'll proceed carefully.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm core product) — use: Yes. I should ensure I'm acting on the configurable/main product (parent) and not a variant. The page header shows "Cora Parachute Pant" (parent) so this is the core product record.
