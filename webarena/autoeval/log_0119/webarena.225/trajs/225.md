What do customers say about brush from sephora

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked what customers say about the Sephora brush. The agent navigated to the product's Reviews tab, observed the page shows "Be the first to review this product" (no customer reviews), and explicitly reported there are 0 reviews and offered to search site-wide or other sites. For an information-seeking task, explicitly stating that reviews are not available on the product page satisfies the requirement and gives next-step options.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I checked the product page reviews section for the SEPHORA COLLECTION PRO Featherweight Powder Brush #91 and found no customer reviews (the page shows ‘Be the first to review this product’

===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide how I search and extract reviews:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I will open the product page and then go straight to the reviews section to read verbatim customer comments.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Open the reviews section before extracting text" — I will use this (Yes). The Reviews tab is already open, so this memory confirms I'm checking the right place.
