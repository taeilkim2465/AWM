## Intent

Presents the monthly count of successful orders from May to December 2022 in MM:COUNT format

Thoughts: The page shows active filters "Status: Complete" and "Purchase Date: 5/01/2022 - 12/31/2022" and reports "67 records found", but there is no per-month breakdown visible. The agent opened the Export dialog (CSV) but did not export or calculate counts by month.
