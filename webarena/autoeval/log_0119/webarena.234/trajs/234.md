===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (locate the latest order via the orders list then open details) because it describes the correct two-step approach to find an order number. I will also use Memory 3 (select the latest non-cancelled order) to ensure I pick a valid on-hold order, not a cancelled one. I will not use Memory 2 (it focuses on completed orders), since the user asked specifically for an on-hold order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Locate the latest processing order by navigating orders list then details" — I will use this. It matches the approach I need: open the orders list (to find the most recent on-hold order) then view details if necessary.
===============INFO - I'll consider the available memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it's relevant: I should identify the most recent order from the orders list and open its detail view to get the order number.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it advises finding the most recent processing/pending order and opening its detail view, which matches this task.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Locate the latest processing order by navigating orders list then details): USE — this matches finding the most recent non-completed/order-on-hold by checking the orders overview and opening its detail page.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. It tells me to identify the most recent processing/pending order from the orders overview and then open details if needed. This is relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it matches our approach: identify the most recent order with the target status by scanning the orders list and opening details if needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it recommends finding the most recent order from the orders overview and opening its detail; that's relevant because I need to locate the most recent "On Hold" order from the list.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it's relevant: it suggests finding the most recent active/processing order from the orders overview and then opening its details to get the identifier.
