## Intent

Edit my post on The Night Agent by adding a line to the body that says "Done watching, pretty cool!"

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent opened the post edit, filled the body with "Done watching, pretty cool!" and clicked save. The page snapshot displays that exact line under the post title and a green confirmation message "The submission was edited." This confirms the edit was applied successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I'll check the memories first:
===============INFO - I will search the site for my post titled "The Night Agent" so I can open it and edit the body.
===============INFO - I'll not use the saved memories because they suggest post-publishing follow-ups or drafting improvements (Memory 1–3) which aren't needed right now — the immediate goal is to open the existing post's edit interface and add a line to the body.
===============INFO - Memory check:
