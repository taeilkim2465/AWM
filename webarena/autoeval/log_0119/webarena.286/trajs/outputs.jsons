The action history shows multiple searches and selecting \"Price\" sorting, and the final page is the search results for \"1TB SSD\" with the Sort By set to Price. However the visible snapshot does not show any product names or prices (and the sort-direction arrow is ambiguous), and the agent's actions/responses did not extract or present the cheapest 1TB SSD or explicitly state that such info is unavailable. Because the required information (product + price of the least expensive 1TB SSD) is not shown or confirmed, the task was not completed successfully.", "status": "failure"}}
