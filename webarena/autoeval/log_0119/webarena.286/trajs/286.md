## Intent

Show the least expensive ssd hard drive with a minimum storage capacity of 1TB.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to show the least expensive SSD with at least 1TB. The action history shows multiple searches and selecting "Price" sorting, and the final page is the search results for "1TB SSD" with the Sort By set to Price. However the visible snapshot does not show any product names or prices (and the sort-direction arrow is ambiguous), and the agent's actions/responses did not extract or present the cheapest 1TB SSD or explicitly state that such info is unavailable. Because the required information (product + price of the least expensive 1TB SSD) is not shown or confirmed, the task was not completed successfully.  
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Validate candidate listings before declaring the least expensive): I will use this — after changing the sort order I'll open promising product pages to confirm they are standalone SSD drives with at least 1TB and check price/shipping/seller details.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 3 but not Memory 2.
