How much I spent on food-related shopping during March 2023

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the total spent on food-related shopping in March 2023 (an information-seeking task). The agent only sent clarifying questions to the user and then clicked into the account page (My Account). The final page is the account overview — there is no evidence the agent opened orders, filtered by date/category, summed amounts, or returned the requested total (or stated that the info is unavailable). Because the agent did not extract or report the March 2023 food-related spending, the task was not completed.

Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'Before I fetch your orders, quick clarifying questions so I compute the correct total:\n\n1

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Filter out non-relevant items): I will use this. We need to exclude non-food items (accessories, bundles, non-food supplies) when aggregating March 2023 spend so totals reflect only food purchases.
