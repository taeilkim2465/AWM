## Intent

What is the price range of wireless earphone in the One Stop Market?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the price range of wireless earphones. The agent only performed searches and selected sorting by Price but the final page snapshot shows no product prices or summarized price range, and there's no agent response extracting or stating the price range or that it's unavailable. Because the required information was not provided or explicitly reported as unavailable, the task failed.
Status: "failure"
