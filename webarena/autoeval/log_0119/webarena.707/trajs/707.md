## Intent

Today is 3/15/2023, generate a sales order report for last year

## RM

Thoughts: The agent set the period to 01/01/2022–12/31/2022, ran the Orders Report, and returned the summary totals that match the page snapshot (Orders 116, Sales Items 349, Sales Total $15,475.46, Invoiced $39.64, Refunded $39.64, Sales Tax $2.64, Shipping $1,745.00, Discount $531.72). This satisfies the user's request to generate last year's sales order report.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I generated the Orders Report for last year (2022

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide navigation and reporting:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it directly tells me to go to Reports → Sales → Orders and set the date range. I'll follow that.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It tells me to use the reports → sales → orders workflow and set the date filters. We're already on the Orders Report page, so I'll apply a custom date range for last year.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the application's reporting workflow and date filters — I will use this. The page shows the Reports → Sales → Orders workflow and the date fields are already set to 1/1/22–12/31/22 (last year), so this memory guided the current state.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Generate sales order reports via the reports module and date filters): I will use this — it matches what I already did (Reports → Sales → Orders and set the date range for last year).
