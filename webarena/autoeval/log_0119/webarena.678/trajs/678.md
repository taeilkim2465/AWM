## Intent

Lookup orders that are canceled

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the Status filter to "Canceled" and the final page shows "Active filters: Status: Canceled" with "145 records found" and visible rows whose Status is "Canceled" — the canceled orders have been listed, so the user's request was fulfilled.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 because it reminds me to explicitly filter for canceled orders before counting or listing them — that's directly relevant to this task. I will not use Memory 1 (it's about selecting non-cancelled orders for "last N" which isn't needed now) and I will not use Memory 2 (asking for an order ID isn't necessary yet; first I should open the Orders view and apply a cancelled filter).
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll consider each memory item first:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (Explicitly filter for cancelled orders before counting) because the task is to look up canceled orders and we must ensure the list is filtered to show only cancelled status.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm non-cancelled status before selecting "last N" orders): Not using — this task is to find cancelled orders, not to pick non-cancelled ones.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 because it explicitly reminds me to set and verify a filter that selects orders with the "Canceled" status before counting or otherwise inspecting results — that's directly relevant to "Lookup orders that are canceled".
