## Intent

Tell me the total number of cancellations of the customer who has the most cancellations in the history

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the count of cancellations for the single customer with the most cancellations (information-seeking). The action history only shows navigation clicks that landed on the Sales → Orders listing; the final page snapshot displays order rows (statuses "Complete") and no aggregated cancellation data or any evidence the agent counted cancellations or navigated to a cancellations/customers report. There is no action that filters or aggregates cancellations by customer nor an agent response providing the requested number. Therefore the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they are relevant:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it's directly relevant. It reminds me to perform a global aggregation (not rely on the current visible/paginated list) to identify the customer with the most cancellations.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to do a global aggregation (not rely on the visible page subset) to identify the top-cancelling customer.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. It advises doing a global aggregation of cancelled orders grouped by customer (not relying on the visible page). I'll follow that approach once I can access the filters/controls or reporting features that let me query across all orders.
===============INFO - I will use the memories because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it's directly relevant: we must determine the top-cancelling customer using a global aggregation across all historical orders (not just the currently visible order).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — Yes. It reminds me to perform a global aggregation across all historical orders (not just the visible/paginated list) to identify the customer with the most cancellations. I'll follow that approach.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I will use the memories because they instruct how to correctly identify the top-cancelling customer (global aggregation, filter for Cancelled status first).
