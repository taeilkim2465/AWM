## Intent

Notify Grace Nguyen in their most recent pending order with message "sorry we are bankrupt, please contact our customer service for refund"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the comment and checked "Notify Customer by Email", but there's no evidence the comment was actually submitted or sent to the customer. The final page still shows the message in the comment textbox and no confirmation or comment history entry is visible; also it's not confirmed that this is Grace Nguyen's most recent pending order. Therefore the notification was not successfully completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Treat canceled orders as terminal): Not needed — the user asked to notify a pending order, and I don't yet see the order status. I will open the order to confirm status before applying any canceled-order logic.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Treat canceled orders as terminal) — Not using. The current order status is "Pending", not "Canceled", so those canceled-order rules don't apply.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Treat canceled orders as terminal): Not applicable — the order status is "Pending", not "Canceled", so I will not use this memory.
