## Intent

Find the page of the place in Pennsylvania where a plane crashed during the September 11th attacks on the map.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for "Flight 93 National Memorial" and clicked the result. The final map and left pane show the entry "Park Flight 93 National Memorial, Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, United States" and the map is centered on the memorial, so the requested place page on the map was found.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (enter a concise targeted name and select the top result) to search directly for the memorial. I will also keep Memory 1 (use nearby place or coordinates) in mind as a fallback if the name search fails, but I will not use it now. I will use Memory 2 to confirm that the search opens a place page/detail pane and not just zoom the map.
