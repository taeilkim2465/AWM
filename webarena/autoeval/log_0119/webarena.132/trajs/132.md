## Intent

How many commits did kilian make to a11yproject on 3/5/2023?

## RM

Thoughts: The commits list in the screenshot shows "05 Mar, 2023 1 commit" and that commit is authored by Kilian Valkhof ("Fix typos in the code examples (#1524)"), so the agent's reply that Kilian made 1 commit on March 5, 2023 is correct.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Kilian made 1 commit to a11yproject on March 5, 2023.'

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not useful — it's about collecting comments and pagination on a different kind of page (comments), not commits. I will not use it.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 (prefer stable selectors) because it reminds me to target visible link text like the "2,320 Commits" link rather than brittle numeric IDs — that helps keep actions robust. Memories 1 and 2 are about collecting comments and vote filters, which are unrelated to counting commits by a specific author on a date, so I will not use them.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not needed — pagination/robust collection isn't required because the commits for early March 2023 are visible on the current page.
