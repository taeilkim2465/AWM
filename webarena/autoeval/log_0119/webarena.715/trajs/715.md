## Intent

Thumbs down the top 2 post ever in history.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to downvote ("thumbs down") the top 2 posts of all time. To succeed the agent needed to show the All-time Top view and click the downvote controls for the two highest-ranked posts. The action log only shows a sequence of generic clicks (no explicit downvote actions) and the final page snapshot still shows vote counts (the top post with 30104) and no indication the top two posts were downvoted. Therefore the required downvote actions were not performed.
Status: "failure"
