{"id": 770, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked to set inventory to 12 units for Cora Parachute Pant size 28 (white) and 56 units for the blue size 29. The action log shows many fills but no entries of \"12\" or \"56\". Instead the agent entered values like 112 for the 28-white and 216 (and other larger numbers) for WP04-29-Blue, and the final page only shows \"You saved the product\" for WP04-28-White. There is no evidence the specific requested quantities (12 and 56) were applied to the correct SKUs, so the inventory update requested was not performed correctly.", "status": "failure"}}
