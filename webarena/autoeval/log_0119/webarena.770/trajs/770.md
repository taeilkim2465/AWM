## Intent

We've received 12 white Cora parachute pant of size 28 and 56 blue of size 29, update the inventory.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to set inventory to 12 units for Cora Parachute Pant size 28 (white) and 56 units for the blue size 29. The action log shows many fills but no entries of "12" or "56". Instead the agent entered values like 112 for the 28-white and 216 (and other larger numbers) for WP04-29-Blue, and the final page only shows "You saved the product" for WP04-28-White. There is no evidence the specific requested quantities (12 and 56) were applied to the correct SKUs, so the inventory update requested was not performed correctly.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they all remind me to verify the exact variant attributes (SKU, size, color) on the product/variant page before changing stock — that prevents updating the wrong variant. So:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 (both advise confirming exact variant attributes on the product/variant edit page before changing stock) so I don't update the wrong SKU/size/color. I will not use Memory 2 because it concerns reorders, which isn't relevant here.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they both instruct to open the variant record and confirm SKU/size/color on the edit page before changing stock — that is important to avoid updating the wrong variant. I will NOT use Memory 2 because it's about reordering cancelled orders, which is not relevant for this inventory update.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 and Memory 3 are relevant and I'll use them: I will confirm variant attributes (SKU, size, color) on the edit page before changing stock. Memory 2 (reorder confirmation) is not relevant here.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It reminds me to verify the variant details on the edit page before changing stock — the page shows SKU WP04-28-White and Size = 28, Color = White, so this is the correct variant to update.
===============INFO - Memory usage:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 3 (both remind me to confirm variant attributes before editing inventory) so I don't update the wrong variant. I will not use Memory 2 (it's about reordering cancelled orders, not relevant).
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 (yes) because they remind me to confirm variant attributes on the product page before changing inventory so I update the correct SKU/size/color. I will not use Memory 2 (no) because it's about reordering cancelled orders and not relevant here.
