## Intent

Compare the time for walking and driving route from AMC Waterfront to Univ of Pittsburgh

## RM

Thoughts: This was an information-seeking task asking for a comparison of walking vs driving times. The final page shows only the Foot (OSRM) result (Distance 8.0 km, Time 1:47). Although the agent toggled the mode several times, there is no driving (Car) time shown or reported, and the agent did not present both times or state that driving time was unavailable. Therefore the required comparison was not provided.
Status: "failure"
