{"id": 239, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The action history shows the agent searched \"nutrition bars\" and applied \"Price\" sorting, and the final page shows search results for 'nutrition bars' with \"Price\" selected. However the user asked for the most expensive product from \"nutrition bars and drinks\" \u2014 the agent did not include or filter for the drinks category. The final snapshot does not display product names or prices (only images), so there is no evidence the agent identified or reported the most expensive item (and it's unclear whether sorting was set to descending). Because the requested product and its price were not presented and the drinks category was not included, the task failed.", "status": "failure"}}
