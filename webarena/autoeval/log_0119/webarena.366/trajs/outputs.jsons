{"id": 366, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the walking distance to the closest CVS from UPMC Shadyside. The agent stopped and asked whether to choose the nearest CVS automatically or use a specific address (send_msg_to_user), so it did not complete the requested automatic nearest-CVS selection. The visible route/directions on the page show a long 964 km walk to a CVS far away (not the nearest nearby CVS), so the result is incorrect for the user's intent. Because the agent did not compute and report the walking distance to the closest CVS, the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
