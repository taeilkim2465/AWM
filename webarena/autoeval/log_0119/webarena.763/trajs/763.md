## Intent

Find the walkway to the closest Trader Joe's from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent correctly used the Foot (OSRM) routing, set origin to 401 Shady Ave and destination to Trader Joe's, and produced a walking route on OpenStreetMap. The directions panel shows step-by-step walking instructions, distance (959 m) and time (0:13), so the walkway to the Trader Joe's is provided and visible on the map. This satisfies the user's intent to find the walking route to the closest Trader Joe's from 401 Shady Ave.
Status: "success"
