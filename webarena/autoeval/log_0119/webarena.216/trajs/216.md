What are the key aspects that the customers don't like about Electra Bra Top

## RM

Thoughts: The agent performed an information-seeking task and returned a concise summary of the visible reviews. The screenshot and action history show 4 reviews with one (ID 316) explicitly complaining about sizing ("Not exactly true to size but still very comfortable"); the other three are positive. The agent correctly identified sizing/fit accuracy as the sole recurring dislike, noted no other recurring complaints, and offered presentation/follow-up options. This satisfies the user's request for key aspects customers don't like.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "Summary of customer dislikes from the visible reviews:\n\n- Key negative theme: Sizing / fit accuracy — 1 of 4 reviews explicitly mentions that the product is “not exactly true to size” (review ID 316

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they both instruct me to surface recurring negative themes and to offer presentation/formatting options when summarizing customer dislikes — that fits this task. I will NOT use Memory 2 (it's about checking whether a listing is a multipack and price units), since the user asked only about what customers don't like and not about price/listing validation.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they both advise surfacing recurring negative themes and offering presentation options — exactly what the user asked for about customer dislikes. I will not use Memory 2 because it concerns verifying single-item product listings and prices, which isn't relevant to summarizing customer complaints.

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories that help shape the summary and presentation of customer dislikes, but I won't use the one about prices/bundles because it's not relevant to extracting customer complaints.
===============INFO - Reviewing the three memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it's relevant to balance positives with negatives and offer formatting options.
