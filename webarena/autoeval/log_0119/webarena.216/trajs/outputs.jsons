The screenshot and action history show 4 reviews with one (ID 316) explicitly complaining about sizing (\"Not exactly true to size but still very comfortable\"); the other three are positive. The agent correctly identified sizing/fit accuracy as the sole recurring dislike, noted no other recurring complaints, and offered presentation/follow-up options. This satisfies the user's request for key aspects customers don't like.", "status": "success"}}
