## Intent

Set my gitlab status as Out of Office.

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent opened something, cleared and filled a field with "Out of Office" and clicked buttons (likely attempting to save). However the final screenshot is the Projects page and there is no visible user status or confirmation indicating the GitLab status was set. There's no evidence the change was saved or applied (no status badge on the avatar, no confirmation message). Therefore we cannot conclude the Out of Office status was successfully set.
Status: "failure"
