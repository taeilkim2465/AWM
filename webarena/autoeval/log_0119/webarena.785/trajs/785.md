## Intent

Tell me the email address of the contributor who has the most commits to branch gh-page

## RM

Thoughts: The page snapshot shows the "Commits to gh-pages" section and lists the top contributor as "79 commits (secupwn@users.noreply.github.com)". The agent's message matches this information exactly, so it correctly identified the email of the top contributor. (Branch label in the UI is "gh-pages", which matches the user's intent despite the minor singular/plural wording.)
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'The contributor with the most commits to branch gh-pages is secupwn@users.noreply.github.com (79 commits

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — this suggests checking raw commit metadata or the repo API if the UI doesn't show emails. I'll keep this in mind as a fallback.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (extract email from commit metadata/API) — I will keep this in mind as a fallback if the UI doesn't show email addresses on the Contributors or Commits pages, so: USE.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Extract author email..." — Don't use. The contributors page already displays the authors' emails, so I don't need to fetch raw commit metadata or use the API.
