## Intent

From my stay at Homewood Suites Southpointe, what's the estimated driving time to reach PPG Paints Arena?

## RM

Thoughts: The page clearly shows "Distance: 30km. Time: 0:34" in the Directions panel and the agent reported "about 34 minutes (Distance: ~30 km)," matching the page results. The user asked for estimated driving time and the agent provided the correct value and a suitable caveat. Therefore the task succeeded.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Estimated driving time: about 34 minutes (Distance: ~30 km
