## Intent

What is the duration required to first walk from Massachusetts Institute of Technology to Harvard University, and then drive to Boston Logan International Airport?

## RM

Thoughts: The final page only shows the walking directions from MIT to Harvard (Distance 2.2 km, Time 0:29). Although the action history includes attempts to request a driving route from Harvard to Boston Logan, the last actions reverted to the walking query so the driving leg (and any total combined duration) is not shown. The user asked for both segments (walk then drive), but the page/state only provides the first segment's duration, so the agent did not return the complete requested information.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It tells me to compute each leg separately and sum the times — that's exactly what the user asked for.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. I will treat each leg separately and sum the times (walking MIT→Harvard is already shown as 0:29).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (compute multi-leg by running each leg separately): I will use this. It tells me to compute each leg separately and sum the times, which is exactly what's needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. It instructs to compute each leg separately and sum times; I'll apply that to walk (MIT → Harvard) plus drive (Harvard → Logan).
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories to guide the final step:
