## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prompt for missing links and posting permissions): I will NOT use this memory now because the project and issue likely exist in this GitLab instance and I can navigate to them directly from the Projects list. If I need an external link or permission to post later, I'll ask then.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prompt for missing links and posting permissions immediately" — I will not use this memory now because I already have access to the project in the browser and the issue should be reachable from the project's Issues list. If I can't find the issue or need a specific link later, I'll ask for it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prompt for missing links and posting permissions immediately" — I will NOT use this. The repository and issue list are already open in the browser, and you asked me to assign the issue directly, so no extra permission or link is needed right now.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Prompt for missing links — I will not use this. The user already specified the project and I can see the issue page open, so I don't need to ask for a link or permissions.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will not use this. The user already pointed to the specific issue and I can see the issue page loaded, so there's no missing link to request.
