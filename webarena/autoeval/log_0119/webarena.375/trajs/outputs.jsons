{"id": 375, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent only asked whether the user wanted an admin or storefront preview and said it would default to storefront, but it did not take any further actions. The final snapshot shows the Magento admin Dashboard (admin interface), not a storefront Luma theme preview. Because the agent did not open or display the storefront preview (nor explicitly state the Luma storefront is unavailable), it failed to complete the user's request to preview the Luma theme for the shop.", "status": "failure"}}
