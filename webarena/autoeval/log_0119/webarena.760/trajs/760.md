## Intent

Show me the route and driving time from Allentown, PA to the city where my E-commerce customer Amanda Kim lives

Thoughts: The user asked for a route and driving time (information-seeking). The agent correctly opened the site’s routing tool and asked the user for the missing destination (Amanda Kim’s city/address) and confirmation of start point/travel mode.

Because the requested information was not provided or completed, the task is not finished.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I will use the site’s routing tool to get the route, distance, and estimated driving time. Can you tell me the city (or full address

===============INFO - I will use the memories about the site's routing tool (Memory 1 and Memory 2) because they recommend filling the origin and destination into the page's directions feature to get distance and estimated driving time. I will also use Memory 3 to remember to provide both distance and estimated driving time by default once I run the route.
===============INFO - I will use the page's routing tool to get a driving route and time estimate — the OpenStreetMap directions panel is already visible.
