## Intent

Tell me when I last ordered my conditioner?

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the My Orders listing (order numbers, dates, totals, statuses) but does not display the contents of any order (no line items such as "conditioner"). The action history only navigated to the orders list and did not click any "View Order" to inspect order details for the item. Because the agent never opened order details or searched for "conditioner," it cannot tell when the user last ordered conditioner. The task therefore was not completed — the agent needed to open recent orders and check their line items (or search within orders) to answer the question. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Search the orders overview first, then open the newest matching order" — I will use this. It matches the best practice for finding the last time a specific product (conditioner) was ordered: go to orders list, filter/search, sort newest-first, then open the top result to confirm.
===============INFO - I will use the memories that recommend checking the orders overview and applying filters/sorting rather than assuming the visible orders are the most recent.
===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories because they directly apply:
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories because they instruct to search from the orders overview, apply a product filter or search for the product name, and sort by date descending to find the most recent matching order — exactly what's needed to find the last time you ordered "conditioner".
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it tells me to search the orders overview and open the newest matching order. That matches this task.
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories because they describe the correct approach for finding the most recent order of a specific product:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it tells me to search from the orders overview, sort newest-first and open the newest matching order. The orders list is visible and already appears sorted newest-first, so I'll follow that approach.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they instruct the correct approach: search the orders overview (not assume the currently-open order is the most recent), filter or search for the product keyword, and sort by date descending to open the newest matching order and confirm the date.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It recommends starting from an orders/overview or product list and opening the newest matching order. There isn't a dedicated product filter visible, but the "Recently Ordered" section's "View All" may show products (easier to find a conditioner purchase) so I'll start there.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it's directly relevant: start from the orders overview and open the newest matching order for the product (conditioner).
