{"id": 336, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The final page shows the My Orders listing (order numbers, dates, totals, statuses) but does not display the contents of any order (no line items such as \"conditioner\"). The action history only navigated to the orders list and did not click any \"View Order\" to inspect order details for the item. Because the agent never opened order details or searched for \"conditioner,\" it cannot tell when the user last ordered conditioner. The task therefore was not completed \u2014 the agent needed to open recent orders and check their line items (or search within orders) to answer the question.", "status": "failure"}}
