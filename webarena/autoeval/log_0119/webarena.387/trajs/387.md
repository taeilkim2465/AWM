Who gave 4 or 5 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK

## RM

Thoughts: The agent's reply is not reliable. The screenshot only shows three reviews (Lisa Lee — 3 stars, MH — 5 stars, Diana Alcaraz — 3 stars); the other reviewers the agent listed (Misba009, Amanda, Amazon Customer, Cally, Bethany Robertson) are not visible in the provided snapshot and the agent appears to have inferred star ratings from a percent value (e.g. "100% → 5 stars"), which is incorrect (percent typically indicates helpfulness, not the star rating). Because the agent misinterpreted page data and reported reviewers not verifiable in the final page state, the task is not successfully completed.  
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "From the visible reviews on page 1, these reviewers gave 4 or 5 stars:\n\n- MH — 100% (5 stars

===============INFO - I'll use the page's product review link to open the reviews for the EYZUTAK product so I can see which reviewers gave 4 or 5 stars.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1, Memory 2, or Memory 3 for this step because those memories describe how to organize and summarize customer praise into themes/quotes. Right now the immediate task is to identify which reviewers gave 4- or 5-star ratings on this EYZUTAK phone case page, so I need to open the Reviews section and read the individual reviews first. The thematic summarization memories will be useful later if the user wants a grouped summary, but they are not needed to simply find which reviewers left 4- or 5-star ratings.
===============INFO - I'll check the memory items first:
