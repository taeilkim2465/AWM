The screenshot only shows three reviews (Lisa Lee \u2014 3 stars, MH \u2014 5 stars, Diana Alcaraz \u2014 3 stars); the other reviewers the agent listed (Misba009, Amanda, Amazon Customer, Cally, Bethany Robertson) are not visible in the provided snapshot and the agent appears to have inferred star ratings from a percent value (e.g. \"100% \u2192 5 stars\"), which is incorrect (percent typically indicates helpfulness, not the star rating). Because the agent misinterpreted page data and reported reviewers not verifiable in the final page state, the task is not successfully completed.", "status": "failure"}}
