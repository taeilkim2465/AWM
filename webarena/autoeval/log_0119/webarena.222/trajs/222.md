## Intent

I am at CMU Pittsburgh, how long it takes to drive to the nearest cold stone ice cream

## RM

Thoughts: The agent used the routing tool from Carnegie Mellon University to Cold Stone Creamery (Forbes Ave) and reported "Distance = 2.0 km, Estimated driving time = 3 minutes (Car, OSRM)". The page snapshot's Directions panel shows "Distance: 2.0km. Time: 0:03.", so the information requested (driving time to the Cold Stone location used) was correctly obtained and communicated, with appropriate caveats and follow-up options. No errors or missing required steps for this information-seeking task. 
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - I'll use the page's routing tool to get a driving-time estimate (Memory 1 and Memory 3 are helpful). I'll fill the "From" field with Carnegie Mellon University (a recognizable landmark for "CMU Pittsburgh") and the "To" field with "Cold Stone Creamery, Pittsburgh" so the routing engine can find a nearby Cold Stone location. After getting the route, I'll report the estimated drive time and distance and include the usual caveats about traffic and exact start/end points (Memory 2).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the map routing tool): I will use this — it's directly relevant and the page has a routing tool.

Note: this is an estimate — actual travel time depends on exact start/end points, chosen route, traffic, and time of day. Would you like turn-by-turn directions, walking/biking times, a route with live traffic (Google/Apple), or to check another Cold Stone location?")
