## Intent

Tell me the total cost of my latest pending order?

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent opened the latest pending order (Order #000000189, Order Date: May 2, 2023) and returned the cost breakdown shown on the page: Subtotal $749.99, Shipping & Handling $5.00, Tax not shown on the order page, Grand Total $754.99. The grand total provided matches the page screenshot, so the agent fulfilled the user's request.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I looked at your latest pending order (Order #000000189, Order Date: May 2, 2023

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1, Memory 2, and Memory 3.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 2 (open the order detail page) because the order detail view is the authoritative source for exact totals and line-item breakdowns. I'll also use Memory 1 (provide a clear cost breakdown and identifiers) so I include the grand total, subtotal, shipping, tax info, order ID and date. I'll use Memory 3 (concise summary + next steps) to offer follow-ups after I retrieve the details.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It asks me to include grand total, subtotal, shipping, tax presence, order ID and date — all available on the current order detail page.
