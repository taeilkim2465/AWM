## Intent

Measure distance between Carnegie Mellon University and CVS (closet one) by walking

## RM

Thoughts: The agent did compute a walking route and reported the distance/time shown on the map (Distance: 1.5 km, Time: 0:20) from Warner Hall to a CVS at 4610 Centre Ave, which matches the page snapshot. However the user asked for the distance to the closest CVS on foot; the agent did not verify that this CVS is the nearest — it only routed to one location and only offered to search others. Because it did not confirm or compare nearby CVS locations to identify the closest, the user's intent was not fully satisfied.
Status: "failure"
