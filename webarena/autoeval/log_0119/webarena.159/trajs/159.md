## Intent

I have a lot of Nintendo Switch game cards now, help me find the best storage option to fit all 31 cards

## RM

Thoughts: This was an information-seeking task. The agent located a product that fits all 31 cards (160-slot case), displayed the product page and price, noted it's larger than needed, and gave clear next-step options (inspect/add it or search for a more compact 32–40 slot case). That satisfies the user's request and appropriately prompts how to proceed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I found a 160-slot case on the page (Game Cartridge Holder Case for 160

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I'll run a short, product-focused search term to find a storage case quickly.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 because it recommends making a short, targeted choice and picking a clearly relevant result quickly — that fits: pick a product that clearly states large capacity so it will fit 31 cards. I will not use Memory 2 because I'm not stuck and should continue with concrete navigation rather than switching strategies. I'll use Memory 3 to remind myself to focus only on memories relevant to picking a suitable product (capacity info).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use concise, product-focused search — I will use this guidance going forward (YES). It helps me quickly find a clearly relevant product (e.g., "32 slot Nintendo Switch case").
