## Intent

Find the hotel around CMU main campus

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to find hotels around Carnegie Mellon University. The action history and final page show OpenStreetMap search results for "Carnegie Mellon University" (university and a university building) with no hotel listings or results for "hotels near...". The agent never returned a list of nearby hotels nor indicated none were available, so the user's information need was not satisfied.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 now.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 now.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm the hotel's exact location before searching nearby" — I will use this. I should anchor searches to the canonical CMU main campus location to get consistent nearby results.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It advises getting the canonical address/coordinates first so nearby searches are anchored correctly — that's relevant.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3 but not Memory 1.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1: yes — I should anchor the search to a verified campus location before searching for nearby hotels, to get consistent results. I will use Memory 2: yes — I will state the assumption that by "CMU main campus" I am using the Tech Street / South Craig Street (15213) location shown in the search results; I can change this if you meant a different campus. I will keep Memory 3 in mind as a fallback: if this named place doesn't work or the map doesn't show nearby hotels, I'll switch to a nearby anchor or manually drop a pin.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - Memory review (I'll state whether I will use each memory item):
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I should confirm CMU's canonical location first so any "nearby hotels" search will be anchored correctly.
