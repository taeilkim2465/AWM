## Intent

I am doing a market survey for one stop market, show me the most expensive product from skin care tool category

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated within Beauty & Personal Care, applied a Price sort (select_option('1208','Price')), and opened the top result. The final page clearly shows the product "Professional Medi-Spa Scar Stretch Mark Reduction System." with a price of $1,799.95, so the agent located and displayed the most expensive item in the skin care tool category (or at least the top-priced result after sorting). This meets the user's information-seeking request.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide my search:
===============INFO - I will use the page's Category filter to view only Skin Care items, then sort by price descending to find the most expensive item (this follows the efficient approach in Memory 3).
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 3 (sort by price descending) now to quickly surface the highest-priced items — the page currently shows very low prices (ascending), so switching the sort direction is the fastest way to find the most expensive products.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items to guide verification before reporting the result.
