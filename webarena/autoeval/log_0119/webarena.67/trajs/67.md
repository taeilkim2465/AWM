## Intent

Among the top 10 post in "books" forum, show me the book names from posts that recommand a single book

## RM

Thoughts: The final page snapshot shows a large image and a page title ("The Eliot–Hale Letters") but no list of the top-10 "books" forum posts or any visible text that names recommended books. The action history only shows clicks and the agent's response did not present any extracted book names. Because the required book titles (posts that recommend a single book among the top 10) are not visible or reported, the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Define single-book recommendation): I will use this. I need to inspect each post's content (and prominent comments if needed) to confirm it clearly recommends a single book, not lists or ambiguous suggestions.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Define and detect a "single-book recommendation"): I will use this. The task requires inspecting post content (not just titles) to decide whether a post recommends a single book, so I'll open posts and read their content as needed.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Define single-book recommendation): I will use this. I need to inspect each post (and prominent comments if needed) to decide if it contains an unambiguous single-book recommendation.
