## Intent

DisLike all submissions created by Hrekires in subreddit news

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for "author:Hrekires subreddit:news" and clicked many elements, but there's no evidence the submissions were downvoted. The page snapshot still shows Hrekires' submissions with score "0" and no highlighted downvote icons; clicks were likely on other elements or didn't change vote state. Therefore the requested content modification (dislike all Hrekires submissions in r/news) was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about posting restrictions and we're only downvoting, not submitting.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (check account/subreddit posting restrictions): I will not use this now — it's about posting restrictions and not relevant to locating submissions to downvote. It may become relevant later if I need to interact (vote) and hit rate limits, but for now we only need to find the user's posts.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check account/subreddit posting restrictions): I will NOT use this memory now — it concerns posting restrictions before submitting content, which isn't relevant to finding and downvoting existing submissions.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check account/subreddit posting restrictions before submitting" — I will not use this memory now because we're not submitting or posting; we're searching for submissions to downvote.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (posting rate limits): I will not use this now because it concerns posting restrictions; I'm only searching for the user's submissions to downvote. I'll keep it in mind in case the site blocks actions (rate limits) when I attempt voting.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (check account/subreddit posting restrictions): Not relevant — I'm not submitting anything, I'm searching and moderating (disliking) posts, so I won't use this now.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check account/subreddit posting restrictions): I will not use this — it's about posting restrictions and not needed for downvoting existing submissions.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1 because it concerns posting restrictions and we're only downvoting posts (no submissions). I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because they concern subreddit posting rules and formatting for submissions, which are irrelevant to the task of downvoting existing posts.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Check account/subreddit posting restrictions): Not needed — we're only downvoting existing submissions, not submitting new content. I will not use this memory item.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Check account/subreddit posting restrictions before submitting" — Not relevant for this task (we're downvoting existing submissions, not posting). I will not use it.
