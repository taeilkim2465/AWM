{"id": 730, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked to downvote all submissions (posts) by Hrekires in r/news. The final page snapshot clearly shows comment entries by Hrekires within a thread, not a list of their submissions, and there's no clear evidence the agent downvoted posts (the action log shows many generic clicks but not explicit navigation to the user's submissions or visible downvote states on submissions). The agent's message claims four posts were downvoted, but the page evidence contradicts that \u2014 it appears the agent may have been interacting with comments instead. Therefore the task is not verifiably completed.", "status": "failure"}}
{"id": 730, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent searched for \"author:Hrekires subreddit:news\" and clicked many elements, but there's no evidence the submissions were downvoted. The page snapshot still shows Hrekires' submissions with score \"0\" and no highlighted downvote icons; clicks were likely on other elements or didn't change vote state. Therefore the requested content modification (dislike all Hrekires submissions in r/news) was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
