## Intent

Gather the titles of Racing Wheel Overdrive for Xbox X reviews with 1 star rating from OneStopShop, and post them in the games subreddit under the title "real user feedback on Racing Wheel Overdrive for Xbox X"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the product reviews and the snapshot shows one 1-star review titled "Only works with certain games." However the action history contains only page navigation/clicks and no extraction of all 1-star review titles and no actions showing a Reddit post was made. The user asked to gather (plural) 1-star review titles and post them to r/games; there is no evidence the agent collected all such titles or posted to the subreddit. Therefore the overall task was not completed. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Infer dissatisfaction from review text when ratings are unavailable): I will use this if I reach a product page where star ratings are not shown or reviews lack explicit star values — it will help identify negative reviews that likely correspond to 1-star feedback.
