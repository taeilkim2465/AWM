{"id": 144, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for total spent on food shopping from mid-Jan to end-Jan 2023 (an information-seeking task). The action history shows the agent navigated to \"My Orders\" and adjusted items-per-page, but the final page snapshot only shows orders from Feb\u2013May 2023 (no Jan entries visible) and the order list alone doesn't indicate which orders are \"food\" without opening each order's details. There is no evidence the agent opened order details, filtered by grocery category, or computed a sum for mid- to late-January 2023. For an information task the agent must return the requested total or explicitly state the data is unavailable; neither is present. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.", "status": "failure"}}
