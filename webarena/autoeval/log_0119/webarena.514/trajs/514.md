## Intent

Add a white desk to my wish list.

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows a green confirmation message explicitly stating "Techni Mobili ... White Desk has been added to your Wish List," and the My Wish List page displays items (7 Item(s)). The action history aligns with searching and adding the item. This indicates the white desk was successfully added to the wish list.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the on-page wishlist control and verify the action — I will use this memory because after finding a product I should add it via the product page's "Add to Wish List" control and confirm the UI change.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use wishlist control on product page) — I will use this. It tells me to click the wishlist/add button on the product detail page and verify the UI confirmation, which is the recommended approach for reliably saving an item.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the on-page wishlist control and verify the action): I will use this — it directly advises clicking the wishlist control on the product page and checking for a confirmation, which matches the current page context.
