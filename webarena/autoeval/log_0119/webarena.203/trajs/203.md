## Intent

Get the purchase date and order id of the most recent pending order

## RM

Thoughts: The agent returned an order ID and purchase date (Order #000000301, Apr 19, 2023, 7:41:16 PM) and the screenshot confirms the order view shows that order with status Pending. However the user asked specifically for the most recent pending order. The action history shows the agent selected the "Pending" filter but did not perform any sorting or otherwise verify that this order is the most recent pending order — the agent even caveated "from the current order view" and offered to verify. Because the agent did not confirm ordering (no sort-by-date or verification), it did not fully satisfy the user's request for the most recent pending order.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it directly describes the two-step approach I should follow (find the most recent pending order in the orders list, open its detail view). I will use that.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they are directly relevant:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Locate latest processing order by navigating orders list then details): I will use this — it matches the needed two-step approach (find most recent pending order in the list, then open details).
===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories that recommend filtering by status and sorting by date to find the correct order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it recommends opening the latest active order detail to get the info; that matches the current view approach.
