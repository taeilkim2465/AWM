## Intent

Search for "xbox"

## RM

Thoughts: The user wanted to search for "xbox". The action history shows the search was filled and submitted, and the final page clearly displays "Search results for: 'xbox'" with items listed (Items 1-12 of 839), so the search completed successfully and results are visible.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Apply the precise subcategory filter first): I will not apply this yet. I'll perform a site search first for "xbox" and then, if results are broad, I'll use subcategory filters to narrow to the exact accessory/console/game type as needed.
