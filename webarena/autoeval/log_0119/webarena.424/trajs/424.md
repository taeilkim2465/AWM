Find the page of the place where Mr. Rogers was filmed on the map.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for "WQED Pittsburgh" and the map shows the OpenStreetMap Nominatim search result for "Studio WQED, 4802 Fifth Avenue..." with the WQED building highlighted on the map. This matches the place where Mr. Rogers was filmed, so the requested page/location has been found and displayed.
Status: "success"
