## Intent

Set my gitlab status as Resting due to leg injury.

## RM

Thoughts: The profile menu in the page snapshot shows the account dropdown with the status text "Resting due to leg injury." (and an emoji) visible beneath the username, matching the filled status. The action sequence included filling the status field and submitting, and the agent confirmed completion. This indicates the status was successfully set.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Done — your GitLab status is set to: "Resting due to leg injury." Would you like me to add an emoji, set an expiry time, or clear it now?'
