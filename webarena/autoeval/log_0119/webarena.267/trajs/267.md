## Intent

What's the closest national park to the hometown of Stephen King? How long it takes to drive there?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent identified Stephen King's hometown as Bangor, ME, routed from downtown Bangor to Acadia National Park, and reported the route shown on the page: ~80 km (≈50 mi) and about 1 hour 23 minutes driving time. The web snapshot confirms those directions and travel time. The agent also clarified the interpretation of "national park" and offered alternatives for other federal sites, so the user's information need was met.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'If by "national park" you mean the National Park Service units formally titled "National Park": the closest is Acadia National Park. I used downtown Bangor, ME as the origin (the map on the page shows "Bangor, Penobscot County, Maine" → "Acadia National Park, Bar Harbor, Hancock County, Maine"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (clarify "national park" vs other protected sites): I will use this — I'll give both the nearest unit formally titled "National Park" and the nearest nationally managed protected site (e.g., national seashore/park unit) so the user gets both interpretations.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (clarify "national park" vs other protected sites): I will use this — I'll clarify the two interpretations (formally designated "National Park" vs any national protected site) so the user gets both kinds of answers or can ask for the other.

This is an estimate based on typical driving routes; actual time will vary with exact start/end points, chosen route, and traffic. \n\nIf you instead meant any nationally managed protected site (for example a National Wildlife Refuge), there are some national refuge units and state parks closer to Bangor — tell me if you want me to list the nearest refuges or to fetch the park\'s official address and a turn-by-turn route.')
