{"id": 269, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for products under $25 in the \"women shoes\" category. The action history and final page show the agent reached the Shoes category, sorted by Price, and selected size 36, but no price filter for \"< $25\" was applied. The price facet on the left shows ranges starting at $0.00-$99.99 (not a specific under $25 filter), and the page displays product images without confirming any <$25 restriction. Therefore the agent did not fulfill the requested price filter and did not show products under $25.", "status": "failure"}}
