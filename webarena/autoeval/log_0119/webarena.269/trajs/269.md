## Intent

Show me products under $25 in "women shoes" category

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for products under $25 in the "women shoes" category. The action history and final page show the agent reached the Shoes category, sorted by Price, and selected size 36, but no price filter for "< $25" was applied. The price facet on the left shows ranges starting at $0.00-$99.99 (not a specific under $25 filter), and the page displays product images without confirming any <$25 restriction. Therefore the agent did not fulfill the requested price filter and did not show products under $25.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide navigation:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it recommends selecting the broad category first then subcategory; that matches what I should do (choose Women, then Shoes).
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide the next step:
===============INFO - I'll use the saved memories:
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide my next steps:
===============INFO - I will use the memories about hierarchical filtering and sidebar category links to narrow results stepwise:
===============INFO - I'll use the hierarchical filtering memories to narrow results stepwise: first select the "Women" category, then drill down to "Shoes", and finally apply a price filter for items under $25.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories because they recommend the same reliable approach needed here: first pick the broader category (Women is already selected), then drill into the Shoes subcategory, and use the page's sorting/filters to surface inexpensive items.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (hierarchical filtering): I will use this — it reminds me to narrow by main category then subcategory; we're already in Shoes under Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry so I'll try to apply the next filters (gender/price) from the sidebar.
===============INFO - I'll consider each memory item before acting.
