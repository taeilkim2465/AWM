## Intent

find discounted items.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent repeatedly searched for "discount" and the final page shows "Search results for: 'discount'" with Items 1-12 of 1063 and product thumbnails visible, and the Sort By set to Price — indicating discounted items were found and displayed. This satisfies the user's intent to find discounted items.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Sort by final/discounted price): I will not use this right now because I first need to find which items are marked as discounted on the site. If the search results include discounts or a list of items, I will apply this memory when ordering results.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Sort or compute by the final/discounted price" — I will not apply it yet, but I will use it later if the UI doesn't show discounted/final price clearly; for now it's just a reminder to use final price when reporting sorted results.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Sort or compute by the final/discounted price): I will use this — I should rely on the page's price sorting (or extract final prices) when identifying discounted/cheaper items.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (sort by final/discounted price): I will use this memory later when listing found items so I can order by discounted price; it's relevant, but the current page is a product detail so sorting isn't available yet. I will mark it as "use later."
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Sort/compute by final/discounted price): I will use this — after we find search results, I'll try to sort or extract the final price field and order by discounted price (low→high).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (sort by final/discounted price): Useful later when I collect and present discounted items ordered by their final price. I'll use this later — not right now.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (sort by final/discounted price): I will use this—once I have search results I should sort or extract by discounted price so I can present the cheapest items first.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Sort or compute by the final/discounted price): I will use this — we should sort by the final/discounted price and present items in ascending order when possible.
