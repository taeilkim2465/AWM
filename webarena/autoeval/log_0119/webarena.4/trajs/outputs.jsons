{"id": 4, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the top-3 best-selling products for Jan 2023. The agent's action history only shows setting the period to Month and the From/To dates but the final page snapshot still shows the filter controls (no report results visible), so there's no evidence the report was generated or the ranking verified on the page. Although the agent sent a ranked list, the webpage state does not show the report or confirm the metric/sorting, so the agent did not demonstrably retrieve or show the requested information from the site.", "status": "failure"}}
