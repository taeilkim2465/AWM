Get the order ID of the newest pending order

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the newest pending order ID. The agent replied "000000299 (May 31, 2023...)" but the final Orders page (filtered to Status: Pending) shows 10 records and the visible top rows are IDs 000000301 and 000000302 with April 19, 2023 purchase dates; there is no visible 000000299 or any May 31, 2023 entry. Because the agent's reported ID/date do not match the page snapshot and the agent did not explicitly state the information was unavailable, the response is incorrect.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'The newest pending order ID is 000000299 (Purchase Date: May 31, 2023 2:55:09 AM

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It recommends finding the most recent order in the active orders list and opening its detail view. I'll use the list to identify the newest pending order (I don't need to open details to get the ID unless you want more info).
