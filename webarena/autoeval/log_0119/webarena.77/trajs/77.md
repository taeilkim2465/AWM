## Intent

What is the total count of Pending reviews amongst all the reviews?

## RM

Thoughts: The page header clearly shows "5 records found" next to the Actions dropdown, indicating the total pending reviews is 5. The agent's message stated "There are 5 pending reviews in total," which matches the page. Therefore the agent's execution is correct.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'There are 5 pending reviews in total.'

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1 (use): Yes — the reviews list filter approach will likely be useful once I open the Reviews grid so I can filter by "Pending" status or view the UI count.
===============INFO - I will navigate to the Pending Reviews page to view the list and any total count.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the reviews grid filter): I will NOT use this memory — filtering is unnecessary because the UI already shows a total count.
