## Intent

Notify Alex Thomas in their most recent pending order with message "Yo, your order will be shipped soon!"

## RM

Thoughts: The order page shows Status = Pending and the comment "Yo, your order will be shipped soon!" is visible under the order timeline with "Customer Notified" indicated. The agent filled the comment and submitted with notification checked, so Alex Thomas was notified on this pending order. Task succeeded.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Always verify order status before sending notifications) — Use: yes. I will confirm the order is in a non-terminal pending state and check the last-updated timestamp before sending the message.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I will verify the order's live status on the order details page before sending any notification to avoid messaging terminal-state orders.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It reminds me to verify the order status before sending notifications. I can see "Order Status: Pending" in the Order & Account Information, so it's safe to send a fulfillment notification.
