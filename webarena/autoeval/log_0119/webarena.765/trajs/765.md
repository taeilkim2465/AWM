## Intent

Find the walkway to the closest Japanese food market from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the origin and destination and selected "Foot (OSRM)" and attempted to run directions, but the final map still only shows the origin marker and the search form with a "Go" button — there is no route, no directions list, and no identified closest Japanese market on the map. The user asked for the walkway to the closest Japanese food market, but the agent did not produce or display walking directions or a located destination, so the task is not completed.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - We need to get walking directions from 401 Shady Ave to the nearest Japanese food market. I'll use the stored memories about preferring routed walking directions and verifying distances rather than relying on straight-line proximity.

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this. The directions panel already has the origin (Kenmawr Apartments, 401 Shady Ave) and walking mode (Foot (OSRM)) selected, so I should run the route calculation.
