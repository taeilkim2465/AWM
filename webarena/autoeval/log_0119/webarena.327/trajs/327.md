## Intent

Show me the "iphone 12 phone case" listings by name alphabetically.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to show "iphone 12 phone case" listings alphabetically. The action history shows the agent searched for the query and set Sort By → Product Name, and the page snapshot confirms "Sort By Product Name" with Items 1-12 of 43033. However the agent's returned list of 12 items contains many unrelated products (lenses, hair oil, candles, etc.) rather than actual iPhone 12 case listings, so the response does not present the requested listings sorted by name. Because the information delivered is incorrect/irrelevant to the query, the task failed.

Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Here are the top 12 search results for 'iphone 12 phone case' sorted by Product Name (A → Z

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Return ordered results clearly and compactly): I will use this — the user asked for listings sorted alphabetically, so I should present results ordered and concise.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Return ordered results clearly and compactly) to present the sorted listings once the page is updated. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because they are about sorting by price, which is not relevant to sorting by product name alphabetically.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it tells me to present ordered results clearly and compactly after I sort the listings. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 because they are about sorting by price (descending), which is not relevant — the user requested alphabetical (product name) order.
===============INFO - I'll use the page's current sort settings to present the top results. Check memory items:
