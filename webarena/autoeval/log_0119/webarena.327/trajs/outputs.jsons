{"id": 327, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked to show \"iphone 12 phone case\" listings alphabetically. The action history shows the agent searched for the query and set Sort By \u2192 Product Name, and the page snapshot confirms \"Sort By Product Name\" with Items 1-12 of 43033. However the agent's returned list of 12 items contains many unrelated products (lenses, hair oil, candles, etc.) rather than actual iPhone 12 case listings, so the response does not present the requested listings sorted by name. Because the information delivered is incorrect/irrelevant to the query, the task failed.", "status": "failure"}}
