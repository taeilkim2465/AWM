Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got no stars?

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will collect candidate repositories from the user's contribution history (Activity) to build the set to check.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compile candidate repositories where the user contributed): I will use this — the "Contributed projects" tab is the right place to get the candidate list of repos the user contributed to.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compile candidate repositories where the user contributed): I will use this — I need to build a candidate list of repos before checking stars.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (compile candidate repositories): I will use this — I need to open the "Contributed projects" list to get candidates of repos the user contributed to.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I'll try to compile candidate repositories from your profile/activity first.
