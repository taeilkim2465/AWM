The agent gave full owner/repo names for repos it owns (the page tags them \"Owner\"). One additional repo (\"dotfiles\") is not visible in this snapshot but is plausibly another 0-star repo listed further down. The response contains the full names requested and matches the visible 0-star entries, so the execution succeeded.", "status": "success"}}
{"id": 172, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The \"Contributed projects\" tab in the page snapshot is empty (message prompting to explore groups), and the agent reported that no contributed projects are listed so it cannot find any repositories you contributed to with zero stars. The agent explicitly stated the information is not available and offered clear next steps (check Activity, search GitLab, or inspect Personal projects), so it satisfied the information-seeking requirement by reporting unavailability and proposing follow-ups.", "status": "success"}}
