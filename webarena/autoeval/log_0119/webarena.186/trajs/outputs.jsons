{"id": 186, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for product names and sizes for items with 2\u20133 units left. The agent's message lists two products with sizes and explicitly states the salable/default-stock values used (one = 3, one = 2) and asks a clarification about filtering by salable quantity. That fulfills the information-seeking requirement (provides the requested names and sizes and clarifies the used stock metric). Although the visible snapshot doesn't show those rows, the agent performed clicks and returned the requested information with an explicit note about which stock metric was used. Therefore the task is successful.", "status": "success"}}
