{"id": 795, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked to change the delivery address for their most recent order. The action history shows the agent opened order #000000170 (the page screenshot confirms this) and asked the user to confirm the address and whether to update shipping or billing. The agent did not perform any address update actions (no edits to the address book or order, no \"change address\" clicks), and the order is shown as \"Canceled\" which likely prevents changing its delivery address. Because the agent did not complete the requested modification (and did not explicitly state that the change is impossible), the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
