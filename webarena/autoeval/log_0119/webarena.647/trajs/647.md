## Intent

Post in technology forum about what could open-source LLMs help the correpong field.

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent filled the title and body, selected the Technology forum, and submitted. The final page snapshot displays the new post with the exact title and full body under /f/technology (submitted by MarvelsGrantMan136), so the content was posted successfully.

Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (post to one appropriate community first): I will use this — I'll submit to a single relevant forum (technology) rather than cross-posting.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (post to one appropriate community first) because we should submit this to the Technology forum initially. I will use Memory 2 (write open-ended, example-rich submission prompts) to craft the body so the thread elicits helpful, concrete responses. I will not use Memory 3 right now because we're not handling an error response.

## Main Prompt

```md
User Intent: Post in technology forum about what could open-source LLMs help the correpong field.

Action History:
1: click('63')
2: fill('137', 'How can open-source LLMs help the technology field?')
3: fill('142', 'I\'m interested in how open-source large language models (LLMs) can benefit the technology field. What practical uses, tools, or workflows have you seen or used where open-source LLMs added real value? I\'m especially curious about:\n\n- Software development: code generation, review, refactoring, automated tests, CI automation — examples, model/tool names, and prompt patterns?\n- Documentation & knowledge bases: generating/updating docs, summarization, code-to-doc, embedding search — approaches and pitfalls?\n- DevOps & automation: log analysis, incident triage, runbook generation, infrastructure-as-code suggestions?\n- Research & reproducibility: data analysis, experiment writeups, literature surveys, tooling?\n- Security & privacy: using open models for threat detection or vulnerability scanning and how to avoid leaking sensitive data?\n- On-device/edge deployment & cost: recommended lightweight open models and inference toolchains?\n- Fine-tuning & customization: tips for instruction-tuning, RAG setups, and when to fine-tune vs. use adapters?\n- Ethics, licensing, and governance: experience with licenses, model audits, and safe deployment practices?\n\nPlease share concrete examples, tools, model names (e.g., LLaMA, GPT-J, Mistral, Bloom, etc.), prompt templates, and links to projects or guides. If you\'ve integrated open-source LLMs into a product or workflow, what went well and what challenges did you hit?')
