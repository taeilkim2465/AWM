## Intent

From my stay at DoubleTree by Hilton New York Downtown, what's the estimated driving time to reach Keens Steakhouse?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for estimated driving time. The agent used the page's routing tool (OSRM) and reported "Distance: 6.1 km" and "Time: 0:14 (≈14 minutes)". The final webpage snapshot visibly shows "Distance: 6.1km. Time: 0:14." The agent's response provides the requested estimate and a useful clarification and follow-up options. This meets the information-seeking task requirements.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use the map routing tool) to get an estimated driving time between the two places—this is exactly what the routing tool is for. I will not use Memory 2 (walking-mode instructions) because the user asked for driving time. I will keep Memory 3 in mind: after getting the routing result I'll report the estimate with a brief caveat about variability and offer to retrieve turn-by-turn directions if they want.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the map routing tool to get distance and driving-time estimates — I will use this (yes). The page shows the routing "From" and "To" fields and a "Go" button, which is exactly the tool Memory 1 recommends.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it recommends using the page's routing tool to get distance and driving-time estimates; I used that tool and it returned a result.
