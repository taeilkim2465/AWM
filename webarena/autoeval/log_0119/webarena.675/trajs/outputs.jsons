{"id": 675, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's task required two things: (1) gather the titles of OneStopShop reviews for the HORI 3D Surround Gaming Neckset that are rated 2 stars or lower, and (2) post those titles to the games subreddit under the given title. The action history and final webpage snapshot show only site navigation and review browsing on OneStopShop; the visible reviews include one 2-star review titled \"I wish this was better...\". There is no evidence the agent collected all 2\u2605/lower review titles (pagination shows a second page that was not visited) and there is no evidence the agent posted anything to Reddit. Because the agent did not fully collect all requested low-rated review titles and did not perform the posting step, the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
