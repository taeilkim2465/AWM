## Intent

Tell me the closest restaurant(s) to university center at Carnegie Mellon University

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the closest restaurant(s) to the University Center at Carnegie Mellon. The agent repeatedly filled the search box with various queries and clicked, but the final page snapshot shows the Nominatim search interface with a blank search field and a world map (no search results or list of restaurants). No restaurant information or an explicit "not found" message was returned. Therefore the agent did not obtain or present the requested information.
Status: "failure"
