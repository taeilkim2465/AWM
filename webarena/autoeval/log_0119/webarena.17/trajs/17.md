## Intent

Compare the time for walking and driving route from AMC Waterfront to Carnegie Mellon University

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for a comparison of walking vs driving times. The action history shows repeated switches between "Foot (OSRM)" and "Car (OSRM)" but the final webpage snapshot only displays the Car (OSRM) directions (Distance 7.8 km, Time 0:13). There is no walking time shown or extracted for comparison, and no explicit statement that walking info is unavailable. Because the required walking and driving times were not both provided for comparison, the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide this task:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I'll note caveats about routing estimates (traffic, exact start/end points, route choice) when reporting times.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide how I present results and caveats:
===============INFO - We currently see the walking route result: Distance 7.1 km, Time 1:35 (1 hour 35 minutes). The user asked to compare walking vs driving times, so I need to get the driving route/time from the same routing engine for a fair comparison.
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Current page shows walking (Foot OSRM) directions: Distance 7.1km, Time: 1:35. To compare walking vs driving I should switch the routing mode to Car (OSRM) and run the query to get the driving distance and time.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to report routing results from the map engine and add caveats about variability (traffic, route choice), so I will use it when I present the comparison.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use the memory items to shape my response:
