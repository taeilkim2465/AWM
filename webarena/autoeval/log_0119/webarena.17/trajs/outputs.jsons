{"id": 17, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for a comparison of walking vs driving times. The action history shows repeated switches between \"Foot (OSRM)\" and \"Car (OSRM)\" but the final webpage snapshot only displays the Car (OSRM) directions (Distance 7.8 km, Time 0:13). There is no walking time shown or extracted for comparison, and no explicit statement that walking info is unavailable. Because the required walking and driving times were not both provided for comparison, the task was not completed successfully.", "status": "failure"}}
