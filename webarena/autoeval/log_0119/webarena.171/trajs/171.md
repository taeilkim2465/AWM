## Intent

Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got less than 5 stars?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to the user's GitLab profile Contributed projects tab (visible in the final snapshot). That tab shows no contributed projects ("Explore public groups to find projects to contribute to."), so there are no repositories to list — therefore there are no contributed repositories with fewer than 5 stars. The correct outcome is to state that the information is not available because no contributions are listed.
Status: "success"
