## Intent

Set my gitlab status as Enjoying life.

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the status field was cleared, filled with "Enjoying life.", saved, and the profile menu was opened. The page snapshot displays the profile dropdown with the text "Enjoying life." under the username, confirming the status was applied.  
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Done — your GitLab status is set to "Enjoying life." Would you like me to add an emoji, set an expiry, or clear the status?'
