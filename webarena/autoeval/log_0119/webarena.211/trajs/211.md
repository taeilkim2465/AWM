## Intent

Find the customer name and email with phone number 8015551212

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the customer name and email for phone 8015551212. The action history shows a search was performed and the agent replied with "Sean Miller — sean.miller@gmail.com". However, the final page snapshot still shows the unfiltered customers list ("70 records found") and the visible phone column entries do not include 8015551212 nor a "Sean Miller" row. There is no evidence on the page that the searched phone returned any matching record, so the agent's claimed result is unsupported by the page state. Therefore the task was not successfully completed.
Status: "failure"
