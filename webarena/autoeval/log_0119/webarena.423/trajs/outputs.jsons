{"id": 423, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The agent searched for \"Hollister\" and opened the Actions menu, but only 1 of 16 records is selected (\"16 records found (1 selected)\") and there is no action in the history that applies an \"on sale\" change (e.g. \"Update attributes\" -> set special price or change status) to all items. The Actions menu is open in the snapshot but no update was applied and no \"select all\" was used. Therefore the task to mark all Hollister shirts on sale was not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
