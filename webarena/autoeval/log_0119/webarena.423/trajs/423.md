## Intent

Mark all Hollister shirts on sale

## RM

Thoughts: The agent searched for "Hollister" and opened the Actions menu, but only 1 of 16 records is selected ("16 records found (1 selected)") and there is no action in the history that applies an "on sale" change (e.g. "Update attributes" -> set special price or change status) to all items. The Actions menu is open in the snapshot but no update was applied and no "select all" was used. Therefore the task to mark all Hollister shirts on sale was not completed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1, 2, 3: These memories relate to inspecting marketplace product listings to confirm single-item vs bundles and price units. They are not relevant right now because I'm working in the Magento admin to find and update products (not verifying external marketplace listings). I will not use these memories for this step.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It tells me to inspect each product detail to ensure it's a single item and confirm price units/exclusions before marking as on-sale.
===============INFO - I'll first consider the memory items and decide whether to use them.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using right now — those instructions about inspecting product details (bundles, unit price, etc.) are useful once we have product results. Currently there are no records, so we can't inspect anything yet.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they are relevant: I should confirm products are single sellable SKUs (not bundles/parent configurable) before marking them as on sale, and ensure I don't unintentionally edit parent/grouped SKUs (Memory 1, 2, 3 — use all). To start the bulk update flow I need to select all Hollister results and open the Actions menu to choose "Update Attributes" (so I can set a sale price/special price). After opening Actions I'll inspect the update-attributes UI and then verify SKU types if needed before applying the sale settings.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about verifying single-item listings and prices; not relevant for selecting products to mark on sale.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use it — we should verify each product is a single sellable item (not a bundle) and that price/spread is per single unit before applying a sale flag. I'll perform selection first, then inspect products as needed.
===============INFO - Memory check:
