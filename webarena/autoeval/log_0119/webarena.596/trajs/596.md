## Intent

Open the thread of a trending post on the forum "books" and subscribe.

## RM

Thoughts: The screenshot shows the thread page for /f/books with the post content visible, so the agent successfully opened the trending post. The right-hand forum box displays an "Unsubscribe" button (instead of "Subscribe"), which indicates the forum is currently subscribed. Therefore both required actions (open thread and subscribe) are completed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (systematic top-N workflow): I will not use this now — it's for processing multiple posts in order, but the user asked to open a trending post in the "books" forum and subscribe, so I only need to open a trending thread and subscribe to it (not process many posts).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (systematic top-N workflow): I will use this memory later when choosing which trending thread to open so I don't miss the top items. For now I only need to open the forum to see the threads, so I will plan to apply the top-N workflow once inside the forum.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Follow a systematic top-N processing workflow" — I will not use this now. It's useful for extracting many posts in order, but the user asked to open one trending thread and subscribe, so the full top-N workflow is unnecessary for this single action.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (systematic top‑N workflow): I will not use this — it's for processing many posts; the user asked to open a trending thread and subscribe, and the thread is already open.
