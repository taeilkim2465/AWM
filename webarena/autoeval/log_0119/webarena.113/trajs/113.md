Thoughts: The agent located and reported the customers who expressed dissatisfaction with the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket (Emma — ID 351 and seam miller — ID 349), including timestamps, titles, truncated excerpts, statuses, and edit links. The final page snapshot shows these two negative/pending reviews (and a third positive review), so the agent provided the requested information and offered to fetch full review text. The execution meets the information-seeking requirement.
Status: "success"
