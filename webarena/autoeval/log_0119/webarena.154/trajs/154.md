## Intent

What is the minimum travel time by car from CMU gates building to Schenley park?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the minimum travel time by car between Gates Building (CMU) and Schenley Park. The action log shows the start/end fields were filled and the Car (OSRM) mode selected, but the final page snapshot shows only the input panel with the Go button and map markers — there is no displayed route summary or travel time. The agent did not return the travel time nor explicitly state it was unavailable, so the information-seeking task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it reminds me to give an estimate with caveats and offer more precise routing if needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it reminds me to give an estimated time with caveats and offer to fetch precise routing; I'll include those caveats after getting the route.
===============INFO - I'll use the routing tool on the page to get an OSRM driving estimate and then report a minimum driving time with caveats.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will provide an estimate with caveats about variability and offer to fetch precise directions if needed.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - I'll use the routing tool on this OpenStreetMap page to get an estimated minimum driving time.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to include an estimate with caveats and offer to fetch precise routing; I'll include that after I get the route.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I'll provide an estimated driving time but note caveats (start/end point precision, traffic, route choice) after getting the route result.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — yes. I'll include the usual caveats about variability in travel time and offer to fetch more precise routing or alternate endpoints if needed.
===============INFO - I will use the routing tool on the page to get an exact driving time estimate.
