## Intent

Find a subreddit focused on topics related to gaming consoles, and post my question, "what is the recommended console to buy these days" there

## RM

Thoughts: The agent located a suitable subreddit/forum ("consoles"), filled the Title and Body with the user's question and previewed it, but the submission was blocked by the site message "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." Because the post was not actually submitted, the user's request to find the subreddit and post the question was not completed.  
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - I'll use the site search results to find a subreddit focused on gaming consoles. Memory 1 suggests posting first in a broad community for visibility — that's a useful idea later (we can offer cross-posting), but the user specifically asked for a subreddit focused on gaming consoles, so I will not apply Memory 1 right now. Memories 2 and 3 are about filtering product listings and verifying product details; they're not relevant to finding/posting to a subreddit, so I will not use them.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (post in a broad, high-traffic community first) is useful — I'll use it. This page is the "consoles" forum which is a good place to post the question for visibility; after posting I can offer to cross-post to more specialized communities if you want.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it recommends posting in a broad, high-visibility community first. The current forum is "consoles", which is a good broad community for this question.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Useful — it recommends posting first to a broad, high-traffic community and then cross-posting to niche communities. I will use this guidance when suggesting where to post.
