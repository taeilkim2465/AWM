{"id": 238, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the most expensive product in the PS4 accessories category (an information-seeking task). The action history shows the agent navigated to Video Games and applied PlayStation 4 and Accessories filters and selected \"Price\" for sorting, but there is no evidence it switched the sort to descending (most expensive first). The final page snapshot shows filtered results (Items 1\u201312 of 233) with product images but no visible names or prices and the agent did not return a product name, price, or an explicit statement that the information is unavailable. Therefore the agent did not deliver the requested information (the single most expensive PS4 accessory), so the task failed.", "status": "failure"}}
