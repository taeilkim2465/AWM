## Intent

Show me the order statuses for order number 170 and 189.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for order statuses (information seeking). The agent's message returns statuses for orders 000000170 and 000000189, but the action history only shows click('220') and the final page snapshot remains the My Account overview (with "My Orders" in the side menu) — there is no evidence the agent navigated to or retrieved the orders list/details from the site. Because the provided statuses cannot be verified from the page state and the agent did not navigate to the Orders page or display the order details, this execution is not reliably successful.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Order 000000170 — Status: Canceled\nOrder 000000189 — Status: Pending\n\nWould you like me to open the full order details for either order?"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (use status filters & date sorting): NOT needed — the user asked for the statuses of two specific order numbers (170 and 189), so filtering for most-recent orders isn't required.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use status filters/sort): Not needed — the user asked for specific order numbers and the Recent Orders table already shows them.
