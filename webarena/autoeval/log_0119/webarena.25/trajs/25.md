## Intent

List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about average print quality

## RM

Thoughts: The agent returned a reviewer (Roxanne Brandon Coffey) and an excerpt claiming the print quality was described as "average." The final page snapshot shows a different visible review (by GoldfishGoldfish) and does not display the quoted "average" excerpt, so the agent's reported reviewer/excerpt cannot be verified from the provided page state. Because the response appears to misidentify or fabricate the reviewer/excerpt and doesn't match the visible page, the task result is not reliably correct.
Status: "failure"

The print quality was average. Using the tools to improve the print quality (cleaning / alignment) were more of a waste of ink. It slightly improved for maybe 10 copies."\n  Mention type: explicit (uses the word \"average\").\n\nNo other visible reviews explicitly use the term \"average\" for print quality. Some other reviews mention print quality problems or issues, but not the word \"average.\"')
