## Intent

How long does it take to walk from Carnegie Mellon University to starbucks on Craig Street?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent set origin/destination, selected walking (Foot OSRM), requested directions, and reported "Distance: 557 m, Time: 0:07" which matches the page snapshot. The user asked for walking time and the agent provided the estimated 7 minutes plus a sensible caveat about variability. All required information is present and correct.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this (yes). It reminds me to get exact origin/destination and use walking-mode directions.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they recommend using a mapping/directions tool set to walking mode and computing a routed pedestrian path (this gives a realistic walking time and distance).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode — I will use this (yes). The page is already using a mapping tool and shows walking directions.
