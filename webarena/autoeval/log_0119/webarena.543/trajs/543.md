## Intent

Update the product description of Bella Tank to highlight the real user positive reviews by quoting the comments

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the product description with HTML that adds a "What customers are saying" header and two blockquote elements quoting positive user comments (with attributions), then saved. The admin page shows the confirmation banner "You saved the product." The action history and final page confirm the requested update was applied and persisted.
Status: "success"
