## Intent

Get the total payment amount of the last 5 completed orders

## RM

Thoughts: The agent extracted the five totals from the Dashboard's "Last Orders" table, provided the breakdown and summed them to $807.40, and explicitly noted the assumption that those entries are the last 5 completed orders while offering to verify statuses. The requested number (total payment amount) is present and clearly reported, with transparency about the assumption and a follow-up action offered.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I used the 'Last Orders' table on the Dashboard and summed the five shown totals. Breakdown:\n- $194.40\n- $190.00\n- $151.40\n- $188.20\n- $83.40\nSum (total payment amount
