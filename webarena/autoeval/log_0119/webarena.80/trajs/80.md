## Intent

What is the duration required to first walk from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street, and then drive to Pittsburgh International Airport?

## RM

Thoughts: The user requested a two-leg duration (walk from Carnegie Mellon University to Starbucks on Craig Street, then drive from that Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport). The final page shows a single walking route from Carnegie Mellon University to Pittsburgh International Airport (Distance: 31 km, Time: 6:57) with the mode set to Foot (OSRM). The agent did not produce the required split legs or the car leg from Starbucks to the airport, so it did not provide the requested two-part durations. Therefore the task is not completed successfully.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the mapping/routing memories:
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide solving this:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the map routing tool to get distance and driving-time estimates — I will use this (yes). It directly applies to getting the drive time from Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use routing tool for driving times): Yes — I'll use the page's routing tool to get the driving time for the second leg (Starbucks → Pittsburgh International Airport).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the map routing tool for driving-time estimates): I will use this — it's exactly what we need to get the driving time from Starbucks to Pittsburgh International Airport.
===============INFO - I will use the page's routing tool in walking mode to get an accurate pedestrian time from Carnegie Mellon University to the Starbucks on South Craig Street, then combine that with the driving time already shown (Starbucks → Pittsburgh International Airport: 32 km, 0:31).
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to run the page's routing tool for the drive segment (Starbucks → Pittsburgh International Airport) so I get an estimated driving time.
===============INFO - I will use the page's routing tool to get accurate times (Memory 1) — yes, this is exactly what we need.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use the routing tool) because it instructs to run the page's routing tool with clear origin/destination to get driving-time estimates. I will also use Memory 2 and Memory 3 (prefer walking-mode routing and compute pedestrian routes) — the current page already shows a walking route from Carnegie Mellon University to the Starbucks with Time: 0:07, so that walking leg is covered.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the map routing tool to get distance and driving-time estimates — I will use this (it tells me to run the page routing tool with clear origin/destination).
