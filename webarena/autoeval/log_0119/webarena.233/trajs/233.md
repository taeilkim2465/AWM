## Intent

Get the order number of my most recent complete order 

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for their most recent complete order number. The agent only performed a single click and then reported "The most recent complete order is #000000180..." However, the final page snapshot is the My Account overview and does not display any orders or the claimed order number. There is no evidence in the action history or the page snapshot that the agent opened an orders list or verified that order #000000180 exists. Because the information provided by the agent is not supported by the visited page or actions, the task is not successfully completed.

Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'The most recent complete order is #000000180 (Status: Complete, Date: 3/11/23

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it's directly relevant: I should find the most recent order with a "Completed" status and open its detail page to get the authoritative order number.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the most recent completed order and its detail page" — I will not use this. The Recent Orders table on the page already shows the completed order and its order number; the user only asked for the order number, so opening the detail page isn't required.
