## Intent

Where is the nearest Starbucks to Carnegie Mellon, and what is the walking distance to it?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the nearest Starbucks to Carnegie Mellon and the walking distance. The page shows a routed destination labeled "Starbucks, Shoppes at Penn Center Eas..." with Directions reporting Distance: 15 km, Time: 3:26 — clearly not the nearest Starbucks to CMU. The agent repeatedly set start/destination and generated walking directions, but it selected a distant Starbucks instead of identifying the nearest location or stating none available. Therefore the agent did not fulfill the user's information-seeking intent.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this (yes). I plan to center the map on Carnegie Mellon first, then use directions/walking mode to measure walking distance to nearby Starbucks.
===============INFO - I'll use the mapping/directions memories because they recommend finding candidates first and then using walking-mode directions to get an accurate pedestrian distance — that's exactly what's needed.

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. I should use the site’s directions tool in walking mode to get an accurate pedestrian route from Carnegie Mellon’s address to candidate Starbucks locations.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this. The page has a directions box with "From", "To" and a transport-mode selector, so switching to Foot (OSRM) and requesting directions is appropriate.

===============INFO - Memory 1 (use mapping/directions tool in walking mode): I will use this — it instructs to set the exact origin and request walking directions, which is exactly what we need to get an accurate pedestrian distance from Carnegie Mellon.
