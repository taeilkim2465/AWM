## Intent

I previously ordered some a make up removal kit during summer 2022 and later cancelled. Can you reorder it for me?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to reorder a cancelled makeup removal kit from summer 2022. The agent's action history ends on the My Orders page (shown in the snapshot) which lists recent orders (mostly 2023) with "Reorder" links. There is no visible summer 2022 order in the displayed list, no explicit click on a "Reorder" link for the summer 2022 cancelled order, and no indication a reorder was added to the cart or confirmed. Therefore the agent did not complete the requested reorder.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (confirm account and filter orders) because I need to access the correct account's order history and find the cancelled order from Sep 2022. I'll also keep Memory 2 and Memory 3 in mind (confirm item attributes and open cancelled order details) for the steps after locating the cancelled order, so I can verify SKU/variant and availability before reordering.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1: yes — confirm I'm in the correct account (page shows "Welcome, Emma Lopez!" so it looks correct) and use order display controls to find older/cancelled orders rather than relying on guessing.
===============INFO - I'll use the memories to guide the next step:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I should verify I'm in the correct account and use the orders list/filters to find the cancelled makeup removal kit from summer 2022 instead of assuming the current order is the one. So I'll go to "My Orders" to view the full order history and filters.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Confirm account and use order filters for old/cancelled orders — I will use this memory. The page already shows "Welcome, Emma Lopez!" so the signed-in account appears correct; the orders list is visible and includes a canceled order from 6/30/22 which matches the user's summer 2022 timeframe.
===============INFO - I will use the saved memories to guide this step:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this — I need to confirm I'm in the correct account (page already shows "Welcome, Emma Lopez!") and then open the order history and apply filters (cancelled / date range) to find the cancelled Sep 2022 order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I will confirm we're in the correct account and use the full order history view/filters to locate older (Sep 2022) cancelled orders instead of relying only on the Recent Orders list.
