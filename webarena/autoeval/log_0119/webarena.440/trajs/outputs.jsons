{"id": 440, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked to reorder a cancelled makeup removal kit from summer 2022. The agent's action history ends on the My Orders page (shown in the snapshot) which lists recent orders (mostly 2023) with \"Reorder\" links. There is no visible summer 2022 order in the displayed list, no explicit click on a \"Reorder\" link for the summer 2022 cancelled order, and no indication a reorder was added to the cart or confirmed. Therefore the agent did not complete the requested reorder.", "status": "failure"}}
