How much I spent on home decoration shopping during 1/29/2023

Thoughts: The agent located the January 29, 2023 order page and correctly extracted the home-decoration item (Bornbridge topiary) price of $260.69, and it also reported the full order total and the other item amount. The user’s information need (how much was spent on home decoration that day) was addressed and the agent offered a reasonable follow-up (include prorated shipping). No page errors or missing extraction are apparent from the snapshot.
Status: "success"
