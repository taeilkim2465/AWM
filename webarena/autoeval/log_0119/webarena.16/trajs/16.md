## Intent

Compare the time for walking and driving route from 5000 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh to UPMC family health center

## RM

Thoughts: The final page only shows a driving route with "Distance: 1.2 km. Time: 0:02" (Car). Although the agent toggled between Foot and Car repeatedly, the snapshot and controls show Car selected and there is no walking duration or any explicit comparison provided. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to present both walking and driving times (or state that one is unavailable); that did not occur. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to include caveats about variability (traffic, exact endpoints, route choices) when I report times, so I will apply it when I present the comparison.
