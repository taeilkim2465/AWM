## Intent

Where is the nearest gas station from CMU 

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the nearest gas station from Carnegie Mellon. The agent repeatedly searched and ended with an OpenStreetMap view showing a destination marker and a route panel, but no POI name, address, distance, or explicit identification of a gas station is shown in the final snapshot or action history. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to return the gas station's name/location (or explicitly state none found). Because the page does not show or the agent did not report which station that marker represents or its distance from CMU, the task is not satisfied.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories to guide the search:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it advises to run a nearby-POI search first, pick the nearest candidate, then compute routes and offer alternatives. That matches the user's request to find the nearest gas station from CMU.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It recommends searching for nearby POIs first and then computing/choosing the nearest candidate — that's exactly the plan.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It tells me to perform a nearby-POI search first, pick the nearest candidate, then compute routes — that's the right high-level approach for "nearest gas station."
===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — relevant. It reminds me to search for nearby POIs first, pick the nearest, then compute routes for requested modes. I'll follow that flow.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it's directly relevant: pick the actual nearest gas station by running a nearby-POI search first, then compute routes if needed.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide this step:
===============INFO - Memory check — I will consider each memory item and decide whether to use it:
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories — they all apply:
