{"id": 237, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the nearest gas station from Carnegie Mellon. The agent repeatedly searched and ended with an OpenStreetMap view showing a destination marker and a route panel, but no POI name, address, distance, or explicit identification of a gas station is shown in the final snapshot or action history. For an information-seeking task the agent needed to return the gas station's name/location (or explicitly state none found). Because the page does not show or the agent did not report which station that marker represents or its distance from CMU, the task is not satisfied.", "status": "failure"}}
