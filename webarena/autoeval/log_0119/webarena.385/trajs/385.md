List the customer names who thinks EYZUTAK phone cases are of good looking

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for customers who said the EYZUTAK phone case is good-looking. The agent returned seven names, but the final page snapshot only shows two positive reviews (Lisa Lee and MH). The other reviewers named by the agent (Misba009, Amanda, Amazon Customer, Cally, Bethany Robertson) are not visible or verifiable in the provided final webpage state or action history, and the agent did not state that it could not find more names. Because the response includes unsupported entries not confirmed by the shown page, the execution is not successful.

Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not helpful — it gives guidance on grouping praise into themes for quote selection, but the user asked for customer names who said the EYZUTAK phone cases are "good looking", so I won't use it.
===============INFO - I will not use Memory 1, Memory 2, or Memory 3 for this step because those memories describe grouping and selecting representative quotes/themes from reviews — they're useful later if we need to summarize praise, but the current task is just to list customer names who said the EYZUTAK phone case is "good looking." The search results are already displayed and I can access the product's reviews directly from the first result. I'll open the reviews for the EYZUTAK Electroplated Magnetic Ring Holder Case by clicking the "12 Reviews" link so I can read individual review entries and collect the reviewer names that mention the case is good looking.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using now. It suggests grouping praise into themes which is useful later if we need to summarize review content, but the immediate task is to find reviewer names mentioning the case is "good looking" (or similar), so grouping isn't needed yet.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about grouping praise into themes and selecting quotes. Right now I only need reviewer names who explicitly praise the case's appearance, so this memory isn't needed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it's about grouping praise into themes; the user only asked for names and brief reasoning, so this memory isn't necessary.
