Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent returned an email (emma.lopez@gmail.com) and the final page snapshot confirms the review author line shows "Emma Lopez (emma.lopez@gmail.com)" with a 1-star rating and negative summary, supporting that this is the most unhappy reviewer identified. The agent provided the requested email and rationale, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It tells me to define a reproducible "most unhappy" metric (e.g., lowest rating, then sentiment and recency, verified purchase). I'll apply a clear metric before selecting a reviewer.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items to guide the approach:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It reminds me to define "most unhappy" explicitly. I'll use lowest apparent satisfaction (strong negative title/text) as the ranking metric here because star ratings aren't visible in the grid.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. I'll apply a clear criterion for "most unhappy": lowest rating first (1 star), then strongest negative sentiment in the review text. This review shows a 1-star rating and very negative text, so it's a top candidate.
