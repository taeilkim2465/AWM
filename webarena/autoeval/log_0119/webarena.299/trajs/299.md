## Intent

Show the most recent cancelled order

## RM

Thoughts: The final page displays Order #000000170 with status "Canceled" and Order Date: May 17, 2023, and the ordered items list is visible. This matches the user's request to show a cancelled order; the agent successfully navigated to and opened a cancelled order detail page. 
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not using — it says to select the latest non-cancelled order, but the user specifically asked for the most recent cancelled order, so this memory would lead me away from the goal.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Select the latest non-cancelled order" — I will NOT use this. It instructs to avoid cancelled orders, but the user asked specifically for the most recent cancelled order.
