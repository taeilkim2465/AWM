## Intent

Show me the shipping method for order number 187.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent navigated to Order #000000187 (as shown in the page snapshot) and returned the shipping method and amount. The page shows the Shipping & Handling amount ($5.00), and the agent explicitly reported "Flat Rate - Fixed" as the shipping method, so the user's information request was fulfilled.
Status: "success"
