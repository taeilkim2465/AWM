## Intent

Show the most recent out of delivery order

## RM

Thoughts: This was an information-seeking task (find the most recent order with status "Out for Delivery"). The agent navigated to My Orders, set the list to 50 per page, inspected the Status column in the final page snapshot, and correctly reported that no orders have status "Out for Delivery" (only Canceled, Pending, Complete). The agent also identified the most recent order shown (#000000170, 5/17/23, Canceled) and offered appropriate next steps. The response provides the requested information and a clear follow-up, so the execution succeeded.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I checked the Orders overview (50 per page

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories about finding the most recent order by using the orders overview and applying status filters and sorting.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide my steps:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the orders overview with filters and sorting to identify the correct "most recent" order — I will use this memory. The page already shows an orders overview; I should search the list (and other pages) for any order with status "Out for Delivery" and ensure I pick the most recent by date.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the orders overview with filters and sorting to identify the correct "most recent" order — I will use this. It instructs to apply a status filter and sort by date, which is the correct approach to reliably find the most recent "out of delivery" order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the orders overview with filters and sorting to identify the correct "most recent" order.
===============INFO - I'll consider each memory item before acting.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it advises to find the most recent order from the orders overview by applying status filter and sorting by date. I will follow that approach: start from the orders list and go to the newest page to find the most recent "Out for Delivery" order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It tells me to filter/sort the orders overview to find the most recent order with a specific status. I should follow that approach (filter by status, sort by date desc) when possible.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the orders overview with filters and sorting): I will try to follow this strategy, but the page doesn't show a status filter or sorting controls. So I'll apply the spirit of this memory by making all orders visible on one page so I can inspect statuses and identify the most recent "Out of Delivery" order.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the orders overview with filters and sorting to identify the correct "most recent" order.
