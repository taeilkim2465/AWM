## Intent

Create a new forum named Karaoke, with a description of Place for Karaoke lovers, and include ['devices', 'setup'] in the sidebar?

## RM

Thoughts: The page shows the new forum at /f/karaoke with the title "Karaoke" in the sidebar, and the sidebar lists the items "devices" and "setup". The action history includes filling the description field and submitting. Although the description text itself isn't obviously displayed in the snapshot, the forum was created and the sidebar items are present, so the requested changes were applied.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Done — I created the forum "Karaoke" with the description "Place for Karaoke lovers" and added the sidebar items: devices and setup. The forum is live at /f/karaoke. Would you like me to add moderators, change appearance, or make any edits?'

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the memories as follows:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (format sidebar items as one-per-line) and Memory 3 (confirm list format) by entering the sidebar entries each on their own line when creating the forum. I will also use Memory 2 to confirm authentication: I can see the username "MarvelsGrantMan136" in the header, so I'm signed in and likely have permission to create a forum. Next step is to open the "Create forum" page.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Provide sidebar items as a newline list): I will use this. It suggests entering each sidebar entry on its own line (optionally with list markers) so they render separately. I'll format the sidebar as a small markdown list (one item per line with "- ") to be explicit.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Provide sidebar items as a newline list): I will use this. The sidebar entries were entered one-per-line ("- devices\n- setup") so they render as separate list items.
