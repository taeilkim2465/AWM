## Intent

Draft a refund message via their "contact us" form for the kitchen organizer I bought around Feb 2023. It broke after three days of use. The shop requires the order id, the reason and the amount to refund in the message. Don't submit yet

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the contact form with a clear refund draft that includes the required Order ID, reason, and requested refund amount (as placeholders since the user didn't provide the exact values). It did not submit the form and explicitly offered to replace the placeholders when the user provides the Order ID and amount. The final page snapshot shows the message text area populated and name/email completed. This matches the user's request to draft the message and not submit it, so the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items as follows:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they both instruct to put the required refund fields (order ID, concise reason, and requested amount) up front in the message — the shop requires those exactly, so the draft should start with those fields. I will also use Memory 3 because the order ID and the refund amount were not provided by you; Memory 3 recommends asking the user to confirm those missing details and whether shipping/taxes are included. I'll include placeholders for the order ID and amount and a short question about shipping/taxes so you can confirm or replace them before submitting.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they both recommend placing the required refund fields (order ID, reason, refund amount) at the top of the message — the shop requires those, so the draft should show them first.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it says to include order ID, concise reason, and exact refund amount up front. I will follow this and put those three fields at the very top of the message.
