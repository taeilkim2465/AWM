## Intent

Post "Thanks, working on reviews" for the merge request related to octovisuals page in primer/design project

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the comment was filled and submitted, and the final page snapshot clearly displays a new comment by Byte Blaze reading "Thanks, working on reviews" (timestamp "just now") in the merge request thread. This matches the user's intent to post that message on the octovisuals merge request in the primer/design project.

Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Open the merge requests list first) because the task is to post a comment on a specific merge request — starting at the project's Merge Requests overview is the correct first step. I will not use Memory 2 or Memory 3 yet because those are for verifying review content and proposing follow-ups after I open the MR; right now I just need to find the MR list.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Open the merge requests list first): Not needed — the page already shows the Merge Requests list.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Open the merge requests list first" — Not needed: we're already on the specific merge request page for "Octovisuals Page".
