## Intent

How many reviews our shop received in Apr 2023?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the Created date filter for 04/01/2023–04/30/2023 and the page clearly displays "351 records found" above the grid. The agent's message stating 351 reviews for Apr 2023 matches the page state and satisfies the information-seeking task.
Status: "success"

## Final Response "I see 351 reviews for Apr 2023 (the grid shows “351 records found” with the Created filter set from 04/01/2023 to 04/30/2023

===============INFO - I will check the Magento admin for the reviews area. Memory 3 (open product page and reviews tab first) is not directly needed now because the user asked for total shop reviews in Apr 2023 (an aggregate), not individual product review text; so I will not use it. Memory 2 (convert reviews into categories) is not needed for counting reviews. Memory 1 (handle zero-review results) may be useful later if there are no reviews in April 2023, so I will keep it in mind but not use it now.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - We need to filter the Reviews list for April 2023. I see the "Created" filter currently has incorrect values (From = 01/18/2026, To = 302023) — likely the earlier fills targeted the wrong fields. I will set the Created "From" and "To" to the correct April 2023 range and run Search.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Handle zero-review results): not needed — the page shows results (not zero).
