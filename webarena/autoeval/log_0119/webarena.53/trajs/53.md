## Intent

How long does it take to walk from Univ of Pittsburgh to starbucks on Craig Street?

## RM

Thoughts: The agent correctly requested walking directions (Foot/OSRM), the page shows "Distance: 1.4km. Time: 0:18" in the Directions panel, and the agent's message reported "1.4 km, about 18 minutes" with appropriate caveats. The response provides the requested travel time and matches the final webpage state, so the task is completed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - I'll use the mapping/directions memories because they are directly relevant: I should get walking directions (not straight-line), set transport mode to walking, and report both distance and estimated time with caveats.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this (relevant).
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances — I will use this. The page is already showing a routed walking result (OpenStreetMap/OSRM) so this memory applies.
