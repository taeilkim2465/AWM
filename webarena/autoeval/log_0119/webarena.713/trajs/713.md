## Intent

Create a best sellers report from 05/01/2022 to 05/31/2023

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the From and To fields with 05/01/2022 and 05/31/2023, but the final page snapshot shows no generated report results or data grid — only the filter UI (and the Show Report / Export buttons). There's no evidence the report was produced (no table or results visible), so the requested bestsellers report was not actually created/displayed. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they all remind me to confirm which ranking metric (units sold, orders, or revenue) the report uses before I extract or present the best-sellers. I should check the report table headers and sort indicator after opening the report and explicitly state which metric I used.
===============INFO - I will use the three memory items because they all remind me to confirm which ranking metric (units, orders, revenue) the report uses — that's important before I extract or present best-seller results.
===============INFO - I will use the memory items because they remind me to verify which ranking metric the report uses before reporting best-sellers. After generating the report I will inspect the table headers and sort indicators to determine whether it ranks by units, orders, or revenue, and then report the top items accordingly.
