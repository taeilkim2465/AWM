## Intent

List all opened issues that report bugs

## RM

Thoughts: The agent was asked to list all open issues that report bugs. Its message lists three issues (#1408, #1478, #1419) as "open" and labeled bug. However, the final page snapshot (search box showing "label:bug") does not display those bug-labeled issues — the visible items have different labels (checklist, claimed, design, help wanted, etc.) and no bug badges are shown. The agent's claimed results do not match the final page state, so it did not correctly present the open bug issues (or the results are fabricated/incomplete). 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "Here are the open issues currently visible that are labeled bug:\n\n- #1408 — \"In error state, focused controls take on purple or red-and-purple focus indicator\" (labels: bug, claimed, design

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it recommends using the Issues overview with the status filter set to "Open" (and sorting) — that matches part of the user's request to list opened issues. Memory 2 (report found item's status and offer next actions) is not needed yet because the user asked for a list of issues, not to inspect or act on a single issue — I will not use Memory 2 now. Memory 3 (open visible match directly) is also not needed at this step because I first need to navigate to the Issues page and apply filters/labels; I will not use Memory 3 now.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to work from the "Open" list (we are already on the Open tab), so I don't need to change the status filter.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find the most recent open item via the overview list): Not using — the user asked to list all open issues that report bugs, not just the most recent open item.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find the most recent open item via the overview list): I will not use this — I don't need to sort by creation date right now; I just need to list all open issues labeled "bug".
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — the page is already on the "Open" tab and sorted descending, so I'll keep that view (matches Memory 1).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (most recent open item): I will not use this — the user asked for all open issues labeled "bug", not the single most recent one.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — the list view is already showing "Open" and sorted; I'll rely on that to find open bug issues.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find the most recent open item via the overview list): I will not use this — it targets finding a single most-recent open item, but the user asked for a list of all open issues reporting bugs.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find most recent open item via overview): I will not use this — it's for locating the single most recent open item, but the user asked to list all open issues reporting bugs.
