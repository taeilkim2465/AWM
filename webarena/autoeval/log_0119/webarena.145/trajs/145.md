How much I spent on cooking and food shopping during March 2022

## RM

Thoughts: This was an information-seeking task (amount spent on cooking/food in March 2022). The final page is the "My Orders" list (showing mostly 2023 and some other dates) and the actions only adjusted page settings (select_option to 50) without filtering by date or by category "cooking/food" or opening individual orders to total amounts. The agent did not present the requested total nor state that the data is unavailable. Because the required information (total spent on cooking/food in March 2022) was neither calculated nor shown, the task failed.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide how I find and compute food/cooking spending:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it suggests locating food purchases by merchant/item text or exporting; that will help identify grocery/cooking purchases if no explicit category filter exists.
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories to guide how I locate and sum food-related orders for March 2022.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I will inspect each March order's line items/merchant text to decide if it’s a food/cooking purchase.
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items because they guide how to identify food purchases and compute totals reliably:
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. It advises identifying food-related purchases by merchant/item text or exporting for offline filtering. That's important because the site doesn't show a "Food" category filter on the orders list, so I will need to inspect order line items or export later if available.
===============INFO - Memory 1: I will use this. We need to identify which orders are food-related by inspecting merchant/item text or exporting if available.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It says to identify food purchases by merchant/item text or export; I'll need to inspect each March order's line items/merchant to decide if it's food-related.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (identify food-related purchases by merchant/item text or export): I will use this — the current order page shows item descriptions (e.g., "2 Canisters of Flamingo Vanilla Decaf...") which I can inspect to decide if it's food-related. Since there may not be a category filter, keyword matching in item titles is the practical approach.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it advises locating food purchases by merchant/item text or exporting for offline filtering. That will help identify which March 2022 orders are food-related.
