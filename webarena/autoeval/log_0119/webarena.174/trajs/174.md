===============INFO - I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3 but not Memory 1.
===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide the search and verification.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (yes) because the user asked for the "latest updated" issue with "feature" in its title — we should search across all statuses and sort by last-updated descending. I will also use Memory 2 (yes) to confirm the candidate is the most recently updated before reporting whether it's closed. I will not use Memory 1 (no) because that one focuses on the most recent open item sorted by creation date, which doesn't match "latest updated" across all statuses.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (use or not): NOT using. It filters to "Open" and sorts by creation date; the user asked for the latest UPDATED issue across statuses, so this is not appropriate.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find most recent open item via overview list) — I will NOT use this. It focuses on "Open" status and creation date, but the user asked for the latest updated issue (which may be closed), so this memory is not appropriate.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 3 (search across all statuses and sort by last updated) because the user asked for the "latest updated" issue with "feature" in the title. Memory 2 (confirm the candidate is the latest before reporting its state) is useful too — after searching and sorting I'll open the top result to confirm its status. Memory 1 (use Open filter) is NOT appropriate here because the user asked for the latest updated issue across statuses, not the most recent open item.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Find the most recent open item via the overview list): I will not use this. The user asked for the latest updated issue with "feature" in the title (not specifically the most recent open issue), so filtering only by Open and sorting by creation date would be incorrect.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Find the most recent open item via the overview list" — I will NOT use this. The user asked for the latest updated issue with "feature" in the title, which could be closed or open, so filtering to Open only would be wrong.
