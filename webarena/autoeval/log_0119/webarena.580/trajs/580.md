## Intent

Create a new forum named sci_fi, with a description of A wild place for sci-fi enthusiasts, and include ['New', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'Post my novel', 'Random'] in the sidebar?

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the new forum /f/sci_fi with the sidebar titled "sci_fi" and the five bullet items (New, Classic, Movies, Post my novel, Random). The forum appears created ("Created 0 seconds ago") and the actions included filling name, path, description, sidebar content and submitting. This meets the user's intent.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prepare posting workflow and credentials): Not needed right now — that memory is about preparing content and authentication for posting. First I need to find the forum creation UI on the site. I will not use it at this step.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Prepare posting workflow and credentials): I will use this — it reminds me to confirm I'm authenticated and have permission. The page shows my username (MarvelsGrantMan136) in the top-right, so I'm signed in; I'll proceed assuming I have permission to create a forum. If creation requires admin rights and fails, I'll report back and ask how you'd like to proceed.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prepare posting workflow and credentials before creating forum posts" — I will use this. It reminds me to ensure I have permission to create forums. The page shows I'm logged in as MarvelsGrantMan136, so I likely have the needed privileges; I'll proceed but keep an eye for any permission or authentication prompts.
===============INFO - I will consider the memory items before acting.
