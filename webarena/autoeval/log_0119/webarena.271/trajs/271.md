## Intent

Show me products under $46.99 in "makeup remover" category

## RM

Thoughts: The agent performed a search for "makeup remover" (actions include fill and search) but never applied or displayed a price filter for items under $46.99. The final page shows general search results ("Items 1-12 of 16201") and the Sort By is Relevance; there is no indication a price cap was set or that results were restricted to < $46.99. Because the requested price filtering was not applied and the response does not list products under $46.99, the task failed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories to guide the search:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it says to apply the precise subcategory first. That is relevant: I should click the "Makeup Remover" subcategory before filtering prices so results are limited to the correct subcategory.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it reminds me to confirm we're in the precise subcategory (Makeup Remover). We are already in "Makeup Remover" (shown under "Now Shopping by"), so this is applicable.
===============INFO - I will use the provided memories to guide my next steps:
===============INFO - Memory 1 ("Apply the precise subcategory filter first") — I will use this. It is important to open the exact "makeup remover" subcategory before collecting prices so results aren't mixed with unrelated items.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Apply the precise subcategory filter first) because I should drill down from "Beauty & Personal Care" to the exact "Makeup" subcategory and then to the "Makeup Remover" subcategory before checking prices.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Apply the precise subcategory filter first): I will use this — I need to narrow to the exact "makeup remover" subcategory before checking prices so results are relevant.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — the instruction says to apply the precise subcategory first. I'll search specifically for "makeup remover" to narrow to that subcategory before checking prices.
