## Intent

Find the walkway to the closest Target from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh.

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows walking directions from "Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Ave" to a Target (Target, 6231 Penn Avenue, East Liberty) with Foot (OSRM) selected, a plotted route, distance 920 m and step-by-step directions—so the agent produced a walkway to a nearby Target. This satisfies the user's request to find the walking route from 401 Shady Ave to the closest Target (route and directions are present).  
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — it recommends comparing routed walking distances to determine "closest by walking". I'll use that approach.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - I will use the memories because they recommend computing routed walking distances rather than straight-line distance — that's exactly what's needed to find the closest Target by walking from 401 Shady Ave.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. It recommends geocoding the origin and comparing routed walking distances to candidate POIs. I'll set the origin precisely and use walking-mode routing to get an actual pedestrian route.
===============INFO - I will use the memories because they recommend finding the closest Target by comparing walking routes (not straight-line distance) and to use a walking-direction/routing tool. That matches the current task and the OpenStreetMap directions UI already on the page.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. It tells me to compare routed walking distances rather than straight-line distance; that's the correct approach for "closest by walking".
