Tell me the status of my latest order and when will it arrive

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task. The agent reported the order status as "Canceled", gave the order date, item list, shipping method and total, and explicitly stated the order will not arrive. The webpage snapshot confirms Order #000000170 is marked "Canceled" (Order Date: May 17, 2023) and shows the items — so the agent provided the correct information and a correct conclusion about delivery.
Status: "success"
