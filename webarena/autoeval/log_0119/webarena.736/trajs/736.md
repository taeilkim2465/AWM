## Intent

Make the LICENSE of gimmiethat.space and dotfiles to MIT license.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent performed a single click and the final snapshot shows the GitLab Projects list — not the repository pages or file editor for gimmiethat.space or dotfiles. There is no evidence the LICENSE files were opened, edited, or committed to MIT in either repository. For a content-modification task the agent needed to navigate into each repo, edit or add a LICENSE file, and commit the change; those steps are missing.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (file-creation checklist) and Memory 2 (confirm repository write access and branch) to guide the edits — they are relevant for safely adding LICENSE files. I will not use Memory 3 (message metadata) because it's unrelated.
