## Intent

Search for "usb wifi"

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the search box with "usb wifi" and pressed Enter. The final page clearly shows "Search results for: 'usb wifi'" with items listed (Items 1-12 of 7123), so the search was executed and results returned successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (use concise, topic-specific keywords) because the user asked for a short search phrase "usb wifi". I will not use Memory 2 (hotel/address) because it's unrelated. I will not use Memory 3 (token-related in-page search) because it's not relevant here.
