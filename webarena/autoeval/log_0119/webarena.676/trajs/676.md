## Intent

Lookup orders that are suspected of being fraudulent

## RM

Thoughts: The agent applied the "Status: Suspected Fraud" filter (visible under Active filters) and executed the query; the orders table clearly shows "0 records found" and "We couldn't find any records." This explicitly indicates there are no orders matching the suspected-fraud status, so the lookup was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: "Select the earliest fraud-flagged order when requested" — I will NOT use this right now because the user asked to look up suspected fraudulent orders broadly, not to pick the earliest one yet. I’ll keep this rule in mind for when we need to choose a specific order.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Select the earliest fraud-flagged order): I will use this — the user asked to look up suspected fraudulent orders, so I should prioritize finding orders flagged as fraud and later sort/filter by date ascending to pick the earliest if needed.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Select the earliest fraud-flagged order when requested" — I will use this memory later when the list of suspected-fraud orders is visible to choose the earliest one. For now I need to surface all suspected-fraud orders first. (USE later)
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Select the earliest fraud-flagged order when requested" — I will NOT use this memory now because the user asked to "Lookup orders that are suspected of being fraudulent" (they didn't ask to pick the earliest fraud-suspect order). I'll just filter by status first so the user can review matching orders.
