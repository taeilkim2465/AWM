## Intent

Update the project site's title to "Welcome to my site"

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent opened index.html, filled it with content including <title>Welcome to my site</title>, and clicked to commit. The final editor snapshot confirms the new title appears at the top of the file, so the site's page title was updated. (There is a duplicate HTML block later in the file still containing the old title, which is messy and should be cleaned up, but the first/title used by browsers is the new value.) 
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I'll use the stored memories as general guidance for editing a page title (open the page file/edit screen, change the title, and save/commit the change). They apply conceptually even though this is a GitLab repository (we need to edit index.html in the repo, not a CMS admin screen).
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Edit page titles through the page edit screen" — relevant guidance (use). It says to open the page's edit view, update the Title, and save. That matches the goal of changing the HTML <title> in the file.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Edit page titles through the page edit screen" — I will use this. It matches what we need: open the file's edit view, change the <title> and save.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it describes the correct general approach (open the page's edit view, change the Title, and save).
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Edit page titles through the page edit screen" — NOT using. This memory describes a CMS pages list workflow; here I'm editing a repository file (index.html) directly in GitLab, so that exact sequence doesn't apply.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Edit page titles through the page edit screen" — I will NOT use this. It's about a CMS pages UI (Pages list → edit → save). We're working in a GitLab repository file (index.html) so that memory doesn't apply.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Edit page titles through the page edit screen" — I will not use this memory. It describes a CMS admin flow (Pages list) which doesn't match the current GitLab file editor view.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Relevant — it describes the reliable sequence for changing a page title via the page edit screen. I will use it as confirmation logic.
