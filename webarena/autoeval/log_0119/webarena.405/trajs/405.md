===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — I should ensure the subreddit is sorted by "new" and skip pinned/stickied posts when selecting the newest item.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — yes. The instruction to apply "newest" sort and skip pinned/stickied content is directly relevant to finding the genuine newest post in r/DIY before upvoting.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2, and not use Memory 3.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (treat sorting and pinned content) — I will use this. The task asks to upvote the newest post, so I must ensure the listing is sorted by "New" and ignore any pinned/stickied posts at the top.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Will use. It says to ensure the page is sorted by newest and skip pinned/stickied content. I can see the "Sort by: New" control is present and shows New, so the page is already sorted by newest. No pinned/stickied marker is visible on the top item, so selecting the top non-pinned item is appropriate.
