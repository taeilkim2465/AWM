## Intent

Tell me the email address, name, phone number of the customer who has the most cancellations in the history

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked for the email, name, and phone of the customer with the most cancellations in history. The agent only applied/attempted a "Canceled" filter and navigated the Orders grid; the screenshot shows order rows with bill-to/ship-to names but no email or phone columns, and only a single canceled order (Adam Garcia) is visible on the page. There is no evidence the agent aggregated cancellations across all records, sorted by customer cancellation count, or opened a customer record to reveal email/phone. Therefore the required information (email and phone of the top-cancelling customer) was not obtained or reported. 
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the memory items that guide how to find the customer with the most cancellations:
===============INFO - I'll use the memory items that help ensure we only count cancelled orders and get an accurate per-customer tally.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2:
===============INFO - I will use the memories about filtering/exporting to make sure I only count canceled orders and can later aggregate the right fields.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Explicitly filter for cancelled orders before counting" — I will use this. It's essential to restrict the orders to status = Canceled before doing any counting.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Explicitly filter for cancelled orders before counting) — I will use this. We must restrict the orders list to only those with Status = "Canceled" before counting, otherwise the tally will be wrong.
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1 is directly relevant — I should filter for cancelled orders only before counting. I'll use it.
