{"id": 289, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked for the email, name, and phone of the customer with the most cancellations in history. The agent only applied/attempted a \"Canceled\" filter and navigated the Orders grid; the screenshot shows order rows with bill-to/ship-to names but no email or phone columns, and only a single canceled order (Adam Garcia) is visible on the page. There is no evidence the agent aggregated cancellations across all records, sorted by customer cancellation count, or opened a customer record to reveal email/phone. Therefore the required information (email and phone of the top-cancelling customer) was not obtained or reported.", "status": "failure"}}
