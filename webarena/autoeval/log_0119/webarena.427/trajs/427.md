## Intent

Find the page of the university that has most Turning Award winners on the map.

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked to open the map page for the university with the most Turing Award winners. The agent only asked a clarification question and did not perform any lookup or navigate to a university page. The final webpage snapshot shows the OpenStreetMap home view, not a university place page. Therefore the task was not completed.

Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'Do you mean the "Turing Award" (ACM A.M. Turing Award
