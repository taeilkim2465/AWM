## Intent

I am arriving at Pittsburgh Airport. Show me the name of a Hyatt hotel if there is any nearby. Tell me the names of supermarkets that are within 15mins driving from the hotel

## RM

Thoughts: The agent performed multiple searches on Nominatim (Hyatt near PIT, specific Hyatt Place, and "supermarket near 40.44578,-80.16117") but the final page is the default Nominatim welcome map with no search results or result list visible. The agent never returned the Hyatt hotel name nor a list of supermarkets, and did not compute/filter by a 15-minute driving time. Therefore the user's information-seeking task was not fulfilled.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use the memories about getting the hotel's precise location first (Memory 1 and Memory 3) because finding an exact Hyatt address near Pittsburgh Airport will let me search for nearby supermarkets and estimate driving times accurately. I will not use Memory 2 (walking-mode routing) because the user asked about driving times (15 minutes), so pedestrian routing is not needed.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they recommend getting the hotel's exact address/coordinates first — that will make finding nearby supermarkets and estimating driving times accurate. I will not use Memory 2 because it focuses on walking-mode routing; the user asked about supermarkets within ~15 minutes driving, so walking-mode details aren't relevant.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 3 because they advise getting the hotel's precise address/coordinates first (important for accurate "nearby" and routing searches). I will not use Memory 2 because it recommends walking-mode routing; the user asked for driving times (within 15 minutes driving), so walking-mode guidance is not appropriate.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it — I will perform a precise search (brand + airport) and capture the hotel's address/coordinates so I can search nearby supermarkets reliably.
===============INFO - Memory review and whether to use them:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (capture exact address/coordinates) — I will use this: we need precise hotel coordinates/address before searching for nearby supermarkets.
===============INFO - I'll use memory items 1 and 3 because they recommend getting a precise hotel location/address first (then use that location for nearby searches). I will not use memory 2 since it focuses on walking distances, but the user asked for supermarkets within a 15-minute drive.
