## Intent

Today is 3/15/2023, generate a sales order report for last month

## RM

Thoughts: The agent selected Period = Month and filled the From/To fields with 02/01/2023–02/28/2023 (the correct range for last month relative to 3/15/2023) and then clicked the Show Report button. The report parameters were set correctly and the report action was triggered, so the task of generating last month's sales order report was completed.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Include order identifiers and date): I will use this memory later when I compile the report so each order in the report includes its ID and date — use = Yes.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use it. I will include order identifiers and order dates in the report output so the user can confirm records.
===============INFO - Goal: generate a sales order report for last month (today is 3/15/2023, so last month = February 2023). I will navigate to Reports → Sales → Orders and then set the date range to cover 02/01/2023–02/28/2023 and run the report.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Include order identifiers and date when reporting order details" — I will use this later when I present the report results to you (so you can verify records). For now it doesn't change how I generate the report, but I will include order IDs and dates in the final output if individual orders are shown.
