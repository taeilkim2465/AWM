## Intent

Draft a new marketing price rule for Thanks giving sale that offers $40 discount on checkout for all customers

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the rule name and description, set "Fixed amount discount for whole cart" and entered 40 as the amount, selected all customer groups (NOT LOGGED IN, General, Wholesale, Retailer), and clicked save. The final page shows the confirmation banner "You saved the rule." These indicate the Thanksgiving $40 off cart price rule was created successfully for all customers.
Status: "success"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Include and confirm core rule fields) because it reminds me which fields to prepare when drafting the price rule so the draft is complete and unambiguous. I will not directly use Memory 2 (Pre-calculate and format the reduced price) because this discount is a fixed $40 off on checkout, so no percentage price computation is needed. I will not use Memory 3 (Set the discount action and value to the correct type) because it refers to percentage-based rules; instead I need to create a fixed-cart discount.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me which core fields to prepare when drafting a cart discount (rule name/description, active state, websites/stores, customer groups, coupon behavior, usage limits, date range, priority, discount type/amount, discard subsequent rules, conditions). Memories 2 and 3 are about percentage discounts and pre-calculation for percent discounts — they are not applicable because the user requested a fixed $40 off on checkout.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to prepare and specify all core rule fields (name, description, active state, websites/stores, customer groups, coupon behavior, usage limits, date range, priority, discount type/value, discard subsequent rules, and any conditions). That ensures the draft is complete and unambiguous.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Include and confirm core rule fields) is relevant — I will use it to ensure I populate all standard fields for the new cart price rule (name, description, active state, websites, customer groups, coupon behavior, usage limits, date range, priority, discount type/amount, discard further rules, and conditions). I will not yet save; first I need to reveal more of the form so I can locate and fill those fields.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to make sure I include the core rule fields (rule name, description, active state, websites/customer groups, coupon behavior, dates, priority, discount action/amount, etc.). I will NOT use Memory 2 because that is about pre-calculating a percentage reduction (not relevant for a fixed $40 discount). I will NOT use Memory 3 because it describes setting a percentage-based discount (this sale is a fixed $40 off).
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Include and confirm core rule fields when drafting a cart discount" — I will use this. It reminds me to set required core fields (websites, customer groups, coupon behavior, date range, priority, discount type/amount). Some of these are already filled (name, description, active). I need to confirm/set Websites, Customer Groups, Coupon behavior (No Coupon is OK per request), and the Actions (discount type and amount). So I'll use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It reminds me to confirm core rule fields (name, description, active, websites, customer groups, coupon behavior, dates, priority, apply type & amount, discard subsequent rules, conditions). I'll ensure these are set or left intentionally blank (conditions) so the rule applies to all customers at checkout.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Include core fields): I will use this — it reminds me to ensure core fields (rule name, description, active, websites, customer groups, coupon behavior, discount type/amount, conditions) are set. I've already filled name, description, active, website, coupon (No Coupon), discount type and amount; I should ensure Customer Groups are set to all customers and then save.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Include and confirm core rule fields) — I will use this. It reminds me to verify the rule name, description, active state, websites, customer groups, coupon behavior, usage limits, date range, priority, discount type and amount, and conditions. Since we already see a "You saved the rule." message and a row for "Thanksgiving Sale - $40 off at checkout", I should open the rule to confirm those core fields.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to ensure all core rule fields are set (name, description, active, websites, customer groups, coupon behavior, usage limits, date range, priority, discount action/amount). I see those fields filled: rule name, description, active, website selected, all customer groups selected, No Coupon, uses per customer 0, from date set, priority 0, discount action set to "Fixed amount discount for whole cart" with amount 40. So Memory 1 is applicable and confirms the rule is complete.
