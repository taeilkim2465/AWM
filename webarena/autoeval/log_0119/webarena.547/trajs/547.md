## Intent

Add a new color option brown to the size S of Phoebe Zipper Sweatshirt

## RM

Thoughts: The Configurations > Current Variations table shows a variation with SKU "WH07-S-Brown" and Attributes "Size: S, Color: Brown", and status Enabled. This matches the requested change (adding brown color for size S), so the modification was applied successfully.
Status: "success"
