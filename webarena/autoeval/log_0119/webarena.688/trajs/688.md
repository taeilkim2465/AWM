## Intent

Promote lahwaacz/arch-wiki-docs to subreddit science with the description from the repo itself.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the URL, title and body and attempted to submit, but the page shows a red banner "You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again." The agent also informed the user of this restriction and presented options instead of successfully creating the submission. Because the submission was not actually posted, the content-modification task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response "I prepared a short, subreddit-friendly draft and some options — but first: the site shows a red banner ‘You cannot post more. Wait a while before trying again.’ That means I can’t successfully submit right now. Do you want me to:\n\n1

===============INFO - I'll use relevant memories before proceeding:
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Format and metadata matter): I will use this memory later when preparing the title/body to match the target community, but for now the user explicitly asked to use the repository description "from the repo itself", so I will not adapt it yet. (Decision: hold/use later, not now.)
===============INFO - I will use the memories because they remind me to adapt the repo description into a suitable post and to check subreddit rules before submitting:
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use. It reminds me to adapt the repo README into a concise, community-appropriate title/body and include attribution — I should apply that when preparing the post text.

Wait a while before trying again.’ That means I can’t successfully submit right now. Do you want me to:\n\n1) Wait and try submitting now (I can try clicking Create submission, but it will probably fail until the restriction lifts). \n2) Don’t attempt submit; instead I provide a polished post draft you can post later. \n3) Try to post anyway now (attempt clicking Create submission).\n\nDraft I suggest (adapted from the repo description and tailored for a general tech audience):\n- Title: \"Arch Wiki offline downloader — GitHub: lahwaacz/arch-wiki-docs\"\n- Body: \"A script to download pages from the Arch Wiki for offline browsing. Source: https://github.com/lahwaacz/arch-wiki-docs — useful if you need local access to Arch Wiki pages or for offline troubleshooting.\"\n\nNotes and recommendations:\n- r/science often restricts non-research/software posts; this repo may not be a good fit there. Consider posting to r/archlinux, r/linux, r/commandline, r/selfhosted or r/programming instead for better reception.\n- If you want, I can adapt the title/body to any of those subreddits’ norms or prepare flair text if needed.\n\nHow do you want to proceed?")
