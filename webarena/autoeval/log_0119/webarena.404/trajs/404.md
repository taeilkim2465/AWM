## Intent

Upvote the newest post in books subreddit

## RM

Thoughts: The agent only asked the user for permission to proceed and whether it may use the logged-in account; it did not navigate to r/books, sort by New, or upvote anything. The final page snapshot shows no r/books posts (it says "You are not subscribed to any forum. Showing featured forums instead."), so the requested upvote was not performed. 
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 'I will navigate to r/books (sorted by New

## Captions

===============INFO - Memory 1: Not useful — it's about systematically processing top-N posts for extracting single-book recommendations; irrelevant to simply upvoting the newest r/books post.
