## Intent

Reduce the price of this product by $5

## RM

Thoughts: The agent cleared the price field, filled in "27.00", and clicked Save. The final page shows the Price as $27.00, so the product price was updated to the requested value (a $5 reduction from $32.00). The content modification was applied successfully.
Status: "success"
