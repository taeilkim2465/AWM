## Intent

Create a product view report from 07/05/2021 to 05/31/2023

## RM

Thoughts: The From and To fields are correctly filled with 7/5/21 and 5/31/23, but the page snapshot still shows only the filter area and the "Show Report" button — there are no report results visible. Although the agent attempted a click (likely on "Show Report"), the final page does not display the generated product views report, so the requested report was not produced.
Status: failure
