{"id": 266, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user asked which national park is closest to Maine's largest city (Portland). The agent clarified the interpretation, correctly stated that Maine's only formally designated National Park is Acadia National Park (Bar Harbor), provided an estimated driving distance (~165 miles) and time (3.5\u20134 hours), and offered to look up other federal sites if the user meant broader \"national\" sites. The action history and the OpenStreetMap snapshot show Acadia was found. This satisfies the information-seeking task.", "status": "success"}}
