What's the closest national park to the largest city in Maine?

## RM

Thoughts: The user asked which national park is closest to Maine's largest city (Portland). The agent clarified the interpretation, correctly stated that Maine's only formally designated National Park is Acadia National Park (Bar Harbor), provided an estimated driving distance (~165 miles) and time (3.5–4 hours), and offered to look up other federal sites if the user meant broader "national" sites. The action history and the OpenStreetMap snapshot show Acadia was found. This satisfies the information-seeking task.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Good question — a quick clarification first: do you mean the specific designation "National Park" (i.e., a unit formally called a National Park

===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 (clarify "national park" vs other protected sites) so I can provide both the nearest formally-designated National Park unit and the nearest national protected site (e.g., National Seashore, National Historic Site) unless you say you prefer one meaning. I'll also use Memory 3 to prepare to give driving distance and estimated driving time from the largest city center (I'll assume downtown Portland, ME) once I identify the nearest park. Memory 2 (prioritization guidance) isn't specifically needed right now beyond following the other memories.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (clarify "national park" vs other protected sites): I will use this — I'll plan to provide both the nearest formally designated U.S. National Park (Acadia) and the nearest national protected site if different.
===============INFO - I'll use Memory 1 to clarify the two possible meanings of "national park" (the specific designation "National Park" vs. any nationally managed protected site) and give answers for both or ask which they want. I'll use Memory 3 to provide a driving distance and estimated driving time by default, and I'll state my assumptions (central Portland as the origin). Memory 2 (priority rule) isn't specifically needed here.

User Intent: What's the closest national park to the largest city in Maine?

Action History:
1: fill('145', 'Portland, Maine')
2: click('147')
3: fill('145', 'Acadia National Park')
4: click('147')
5: send_msg_to_user('Good question — a quick clarification first: do you mean the specific designation "National Park" (i.e., a unit formally called a National Park) or any federally managed national site/park? I\'ll cover both briefly.\n\n- If you mean the formal designation "National Park": Maine\'s only National Park is Acadia National Park (Bar Harbor area). From central Portland, ME (assumed origin), Acadia is about 165 miles (≈265 km) by road, with an estimated driving time of roughly 3.5–4 hours depending on route and traffic (I assumed a typical driving route via I‑295/US‑1).\n\n- If you meant any national (federally managed) protected site: I can look up the nearest National Park Service units (National Historic Sites, National Monuments, etc.) to Portland — would you like me to search for the closest NPS site instead and give exact driving directions and times?\n\nTell me which interpretation you want (formal National Park or any national site), and whether you want a precise driving route/time; I can compute that now.')
