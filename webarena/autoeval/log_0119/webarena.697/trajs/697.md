## Intent

Add a simple product named Swaatch Smart Watch with 42 in stock, available in size uni-size and color Blue, priced at $769.99

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the product name, SKU, price, and stock (42) and set Color to Blue, but it did not add or select the required Size "uni-size" — the size dropdown shows "55 cm" and the agent asked the user whether to add a new size option. Because the requested size was not created or selected, the product was not fully added as specified.
Status: "failure"
