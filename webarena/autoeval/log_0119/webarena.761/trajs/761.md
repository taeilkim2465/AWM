## Intent

Get directions from Carnegie Science Museum to Hunt library CMU using walk options.

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled origin and destination and selected "Foot (OSRM)" then clicked Go, but the final snapshot shows no route or turn-by-turn directions — only the input fields and a welcome popup on the map. The requested walking directions from Carnegie Science Museum to Hunt Library were not displayed or provided, so the task was not completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use the memories to guide how I get walking directions and what to report.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (precise origin & walking mode): I will use this — I'll enter a specific origin address and switch to walking so the route is computed as a pedestrian route.
