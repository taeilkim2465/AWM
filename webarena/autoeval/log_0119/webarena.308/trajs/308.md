## Intent

Tell me who has made the most contributions, in terms of number of commits, to the primer/design project

## RM

Thoughts: The Contributors page in the snapshot clearly shows "Shawn Allen — 95 commits (shawn.allen@github.com)" as the top contributor, and the agent's message correctly reported that name, commit count, and email. This satisfies the information-seeking intent (the agent provided the requested information). 
Status: "success"

## Final Response 'Shawn Allen is the top contributor with 95 commits (shawn.allen@github.com

===============INFO - Memory 1 (compile candidate repos): I will not use this — the Primer / design repository is already visible on the Projects page so I don't need to compile candidates.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compile candidate repositories): I will not use this — we're already on the specific primer/design project page, so compiling candidate repos is unnecessary.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Not useful for this step — it suggests compiling candidate repos from the user's contribution history, but the user asked about a specific repository (primer/design).
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Compile candidate repositories): Not needed — we're already on the primer/design project's Contributors page, so we don't need to gather candidate repos.
