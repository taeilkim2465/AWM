{"id": 315, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The page snapshot clearly shows the contributor list and verifies the top two entries: \"Erik Linder-Nor\u00e9n \u2014 85 commits (eriklindernoren@live.se)\" and \"eriklindernoren \u2014 60 commits (eriklindernoren@gmail.com)\", which match the agent's response. The agent also returned a third contributor with email and commit count; while that third entry isn't visible in the provided snapshot, the agent accessed the Contributors view and returned a ranked top-3 list with emails as requested. The response therefore supplies the requested information (top 3 contributors with emails, ranked by commits).", "status": "success"}}
