## Intent

Checkout merge requests requiring my review

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows the Merge Requests list with the filter "Reviewer = Byte Blaze" applied and five open MRs visible, which matches the user's intent to check out merge requests requiring their review. The agent's clicks resulted in the correct filtered view, so the task was completed successfully.
Status: "success"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 to open the merge requests overview first (needed to see MR filters and list). I will use Memory 2 to plan applying the "assigned to me" / review-related filter once the merge requests page is open. I will keep Memory 3 in mind for when I open individual MRs to review (open → change status → submit → verify), but it's not needed for this navigation step.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Open the merge requests list first" — I will use this memory. The merge requests menu is already open in the page, so it matches the memory and confirms we're in the right place.
