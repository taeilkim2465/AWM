## Intent

Measure distance between Carnegie Mellon University and Carnegie Music Hall by walking

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information-seeking task (measure walking distance). The action history shows the agent requested foot directions and the page snapshot/Directions panel clearly displays "Distance: 778m. Time: 0:10." The agent's message correctly reports 778 m, estimated 10 minutes, and sensible unit conversions and caveats. The requested information was provided, so the execution is successful.
Status: "success"

===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode to get accurate pedestrian distances.
===============INFO - I'll use the mapping directions tool on the page and request a walking route.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use a mapping/directions tool with walking mode — I will use this (the page is an OpenStreetMap directions tool already set to Foot/OSRM).
