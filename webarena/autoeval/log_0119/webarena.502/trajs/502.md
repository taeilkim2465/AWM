## Intent

Make all Gobi HeatTec Tee as out of stock

Thoughts: The action history shows attempts to set quantity to 0 and select "Out of Stock" then save, but the final page screenshot for Gobi HeatTec® Tee-XS-Orange still shows Quantity = 99 (and the product is enabled). That indicates the stock change was not applied to this variant (and the task required making all Gobi HeatTec Tee out of stock), so the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"
