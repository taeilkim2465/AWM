## Intent

Start a private project agi_index with HTML template and add Vinta Chen as members

## RM

Thoughts: The agi_index project appears to have been created (the project page is open), but the "Invite members" modal shows a validation error ("Please add members to invite") and the "Vinta Chen" entry is highlighted in red with the Invite button disabled. That indicates the member was not successfully added (the name wasn't resolved/selected as a valid user or email). Because adding Vinta Chen failed, the user's overall intent (create private project with HTML template and add that member) is not fully satisfied.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Invite members through the project's Members/Invite panel..." — I will not use it right now because we're still starting the project; inviting comes after creating and confirming the project.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (invite via Members/Invite UI and verify): I will use this later when adding Vinta Chen as a member so I can invite through the project’s Members/Invite panel and confirm the addition. Use: yes.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the project's Members/Invite UI and verify additions" — I will use this later when adding Vinta Chen to the project, so YES, I will follow it (open Members/Invite panel and verify membership/pending invites).
===============INFO - Memory check:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the project's Members/Invite UI and verify additions — I will use this memory because I need to open the project's Members or Invite panel and confirm the invite succeeds.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the project's Members/Invite UI and verify additions): I will use this — we need to invite/add Vinta Chen via the project's Members/Invite panel and verify the member appears.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the project's Members/Invite UI and verify additions): I will use this — it directly instructs to open the Members/Invite panel and verify changes, which is exactly what we need to add Vinta Chen.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Invite via Members/Invite UI): I will use this — it specifically says to open the project's Members/Invite section and verify the invite. The "Invite members" button is visible on the current page and is the correct UI to add a user.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Use the project's Members/Invite UI and verify additions): I'll use this — the Invite members modal is already open and I should use it to add the user and then verify the members list afterwards.
