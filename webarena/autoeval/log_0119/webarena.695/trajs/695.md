## Intent

Add a simple product named Energy-Bulk Man Yoga Pant with 50 in stock, available in size 38 and color yellow, priced at $69.99

## RM

Thoughts: The action log shows the agent filled name, SKU, price, quantity and set status to "In Stock", but the final Products page displays "We couldn't find any records." That indicates the product was not saved/published or indexing/list view was not updated. Also there is no evidence size (38) and color (yellow) attributes were set or saved. Because the product does not appear in the product list and required attributes aren’t confirmed, the task failed.

Status: "failure"
