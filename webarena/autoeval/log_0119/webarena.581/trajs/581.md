## Intent

Create a new forum named cmu_lti, with a description of Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, and include ['announcement', 'paper', 'alumni'] in the sidebar?

## RM

Thoughts: The forum /f/cmu_lti was created (title shown) and the sidebar lists the three items (announcement, paper, alumni), but the requested description "Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University" does not appear anywhere on the page snapshot. Because the description requirement was not satisfied, the task is not fully completed.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - I'll consider the memory items before acting:
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Prepare posting workflow and credentials..." — I will use this. I see the top-right shows "MarvelsGrantMan136", so I'm signed in and can proceed, but it's good I checked authentication before creating the forum.
