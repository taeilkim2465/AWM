## Intent

Create a coupons report from 05/01/2021 to 05/15/2023

## RM

Thoughts: The agent filled the From and To fields correctly (5/1/21 and 5/15/23) and attempted a click, but the final page snapshot still shows the filter UI with no generated report content or results visible (the Show Report area and filters remain unchanged). There is no evidence the coupons report was produced. Therefore the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they describe the standard workflow for generating reports in the Reports area and explicitly mention using date filters and entering a From/To date range — exactly what’s needed for a coupons report across a specific date span. I will not use Memory 3 because it specifically focuses on the sales/orders report workflow, which may not apply to a coupons report.
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Use the Reports workflow and date filters to generate order reports" — Relevant (helps guide where to set the From/To dates and that I should open the reports → sales area). I will use it.
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use the Reports workflow and date filters to generate order reports.
