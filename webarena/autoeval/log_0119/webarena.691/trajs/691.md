## Intent

Draft an email to the shop owner via their contact us function for a coupon as I plan to make a bulk purchase

## RM

Thoughts: The action history shows the agent attempted to fill the contact form with the detailed bulk-purchase message, but the final page snapshot shows the message textarea contains only a short signature (not the requested bulk-purchase request) and the phone field is empty. There is also no evidence the form was submitted. Because the intended email content was not correctly placed (and not sent), the task was not completed successfully.
