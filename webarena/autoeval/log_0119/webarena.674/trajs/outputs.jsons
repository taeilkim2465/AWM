{"id": 674, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The reviews page snapshot shows one 3-star review titled \"Based arrived broken but game itself works\", so the agent located at least that review title. However the user asked for all review titles with 3 stars and less and then to post them to the games subreddit under the given title. The action history shows only navigation on the product page and pagination; there is no evidence the agent collected all qualifying review titles (page 2 likely contains more) nor any action posting to Reddit. Because the posting step was not performed and the collection appears incomplete, the overall task failed.", "status": "failure"}}
