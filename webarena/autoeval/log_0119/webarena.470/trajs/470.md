## Intent

Cancel order 302

## RM

Thoughts: The confirmation dialog "Are you sure you want to cancel this order?" is still visible in the final screenshot and the order status shown behind it is "Pending" (order #000000302). That indicates the cancellation was not completed (the agent did not successfully close/confirm the dialog and update the order status). Therefore the cancel action was not finished.
Status: "failure"

## Final Response

===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm requested order status before acting): I will use this. Before cancelling, I must ensure I'm viewing the correct orders list and that the order isn't already canceled.
===============INFO - Memory review:
===============INFO - Memory 1: "Confirm requested order status before acting" — I will use this. The user asked to cancel order "302#"; before I attempt any cancellation I should locate the order and confirm its current status in the UI to avoid acting on a wrong/already-cancelled order.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 because it reminds me to confirm the order's current status in the UI before attempting to cancel — that prevents acting on the wrong subset.
===============INFO - I will use Memory 1 (Confirm requested order status before acting) — the order status is visible on the page as "Pending", so I will confirm that before cancelling.
===============INFO - Memory 1 (Confirm requested order status before acting): USE. The order page for #000000302 is visible and shows Order Status = "Pending", so it's the correct order and I can proceed.
