## Intent

Tell me when I last ordered my toothpaste?

## RM

Thoughts: The final page shows an order detail (Order #000000170, Order Date: May 17, 2023) and the items listed are a table lamp, coat rack, etc. There is no toothpaste shown on this order page and no explicit statement by the agent that toothpaste was not found or when the user last ordered it. Because the information the user requested (when they last ordered toothpaste) is not presented or explicitly declared unavailable, the task was not completed successfully.
Status: "failure"

===============INFO - I will use the saved memories because they directly describe the correct procedure for finding when a specific product (toothpaste) was last ordered:
===============INFO - Memory 1: Use — It's relevant: it instructs to start at the orders overview, search/filter by product, and sort newest→oldest. There isn't a visible product filter on this page, but the guidance to start from the orders list and open the newest matching order is applicable.

===============INFO - I will use the saved memories because they describe the correct strategy for this task:
===============INFO - I will use the stored memories because they all recommend the same reliable approach: start at the orders overview, search/filter for the product name, sort newest→oldest, and open the top matching order to confirm the date. That matches what the user asked (when they last ordered toothpaste).
===============INFO - I'll use the memories that recommend starting at the orders overview and checking the newest orders first.
