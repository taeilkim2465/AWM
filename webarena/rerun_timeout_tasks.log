Prompt:
 Given a list of web navigation tasks, your task is to extract the common workflows to solve these tasks.
Each given task contains a natural language instruction, and a series of actions to solve the task. You need to find the repetitive subset of actions across multiple tasks, and extract each of them out as a workflow.
Each workflow should be a commonly-reused sub-routine of the tasks. Do not generate similar or overlapping workflows. Each workflow should have at least two steps. Represent the non-fixed elements (input text, button strings) with descriptive variable names as shown in the example.
Keep the values of invariant elements, e.g., id of "Search" or "Customers", as they will share and stay invariant across tasks.
Try to generate as many workflows that can cover all the tasks in the input list.

## Summary Workflows 


I can do that — please paste the list of web navigation tasks (each task should include the natural-language instruction and the sequence of actions). 

A few notes on the expected input format so I can produce correct workflows:
- For each task include the instruction and the action sequence (click/hover/type/send_msg_to_user/etc.).
- Keep action ids and literal strings exactly as they appear (invariant elements).
- If you like, separate tasks with a blank line.

What I will produce:
- A set of non-overlapping workflows (each 2+ steps) that capture commonly repeated sub-routines across the tasks.
- Use descriptive variable names for non-fixed elements (e.g., click('My Account') → click('ACCOUNT_LINK')).
- Avoid duplicate/overlapping workflows; aim to cover as many tasks as possible.

If you want, you can also specify:
- How many workflows you want at most, or
- Whether to prefer more granular (many small workflows) or broader (fewer, longer workflows) routines.

Paste the tasks and I’ll extract the workflows.

## Concrete Examples

## Summary Workflows 


I don't see the list of tasks to analyze. Please paste the tasks (each task should include the natural-language instruction and its sequence of actions/thinks, like in your examples). 

Guidelines for best results:
- Include all tasks you want processed in the same format as your examples (think/action entries).
- Actions should show clicks/hovers/inputs (IDs or visible strings).
- If some elements are variable (input text, button labels), that's fine — I'll replace them with descriptive variable names in the workflows.

What I'll produce after you paste the tasks:
- A set of non-overlapping common workflows (each with at least two steps).
- Steps will use concrete invariant elements (IDs/strings) where present and descriptive variable names for non-fixed elements (e.g., enter_text('SEARCH_TERM')).
- No redundant/overlapping workflows; as many workflows as needed to cover the tasks.

Paste the tasks and I'll extract the workflows.

## Concrete Examples

## Summary Workflows 


I don’t see the list of tasks to process. Please paste the tasks (each task should include the natural-language instruction and the sequence of actions). 

Preferable formats:
- Plain text: one task after another (include the actions like click('227'), hover('735'), send_msg_to_user(...)).
- JSON array: each item with "instruction" and "actions" fields.

Notes about the output I’ll produce:
- I will extract distinct, non-overlapping workflows (each a commonly reused subroutine).
- Each workflow will contain at least two steps, using descriptive variable names for non-fixed inputs (e.g., click('My Account') → click('ACCOUNT_LINK_ID') or send_msg_to_user('...') → send_msg_to_user('<RESPONSE_TEXT>')).
- I will keep invariant element values exactly as they appear (e.g., click('Search')).
- I’ll try to produce workflows that together cover as many tasks as possible.

If you want, paste a small sample (3–10 tasks) and I’ll return the extracted workflows.

Prompt:
 Given a list of web navigation tasks, your task is to extract the common workflows to solve these tasks.
Each given task contains a natural language instruction, and a series of actions to solve the task. You need to find the repetitive subset of actions across multiple tasks, and extract each of them out as a workflow.
Each workflow should be a commonly-reused sub-routine of the tasks. Do not generate similar or overlapping workflows. Each workflow should have at least two steps. Represent the non-fixed elements (input text, button strings) with descriptive variable names as shown in the example.
Keep the values of invariant elements, e.g., id of "Search" or "Customers", as they will share and stay invariant across tasks.
Try to generate as many workflows that can cover all the tasks in the input list.

Prompt:
 Given a list of web navigation tasks, your task is to extract the common workflows to solve these tasks.
Each given task contains a natural language instruction, and a series of actions to solve the task. You need to find the repetitive subset of actions across multiple tasks, and extract each of them out as a workflow.
Each workflow should be a commonly-reused sub-routine of the tasks. Do not generate similar or overlapping workflows. Each workflow should have at least two steps. Represent the non-fixed elements (input text, button strings) with descriptive variable names as shown in the example.
Keep the values of invariant elements, e.g., id of "Search" or "Customers", as they will share and stay invariant across tasks.
Try to generate as many workflows that can cover all the tasks in the input list.
