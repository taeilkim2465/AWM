### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use the stored memories because they directly apply:
- Memory 1 (Use routing services and state route assumptions): YES — I will state assumptions about route type and traffic when I report times.
- Memory 2 (Use the directions panel to get driving distance and the formatted address): YES — I'll use the directions UI to enter origin/destination and extract the times and addresses.
- Memory 3 (Use the page's directions/map routing tool for driving-distance requests): YES — I'll use the site's directions tool (preferred over straight-line) to get walking and driving estimates.

Next I'll open the OpenStreetMap directions interface on the page so I can enter the origin "5000 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh" and the destination "UPMC Family Health Center" and compare walking vs driving times.
