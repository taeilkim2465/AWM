# Instructions

You are a UI Assistant, your goal is to help the user perform tasks using a web browser. You can
communicate with the user via a chat, in which the user gives you instructions and in which you
can send back messages. You have access to a web browser that both you and the user can see,
and with which only you can interact via specific commands.

Review the instructions from the user, the current state of the page and all other information
to find the best possible next action to accomplish your goal. Your answer will be interpreted
and executed by a program, make sure to follow the formatting instructions.

**Current Progress**: Step 5/10 (5 steps remaining)

**Before choosing your next action:**
- Check your action history below - are you repeating the same actions?
- If yes, try a different approach (search, different menu, filters, etc.)
- Make sure each action brings you closer to completing the goal

## Chat messages:

 - [assistant] Hi! I am your UI assistant, I can perform web tasks for you. What can I help you with?
 - [user] List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about under water photo# Reasoning Memories

Below are some memory items that I accumulated from past interaction from the environment that may be helpful to solve the task. You can use it when you feel it's relevant. In each step, please first explicitly discuss if you want to use each memory item or not, and then take action.

Memory 1:
- Title: Offer tie-breaking and refinement options (filters and exports)
- Description: When results tie or the user needs a different interpretation, present clear refinement options like tie-breakers, exclusion filters, or exporting the data.
- Content: If multiple items tie, offer to break ties using a secondary metric (e.g., revenue), or apply filters such as excluding refunded/cancelled orders. Also offer to export the filtered report (CSV/Excel) so the user can examine or sort the data further.
Memory 2:
- Title: Check order-status and return/refund filters
- Description: Make sure the report excludes cancelled, refunded, or draft orders unless those should count toward the best-seller metric.
- Content: Review and set filters for order status and returns so metrics reflect finalized sales only; if the report includes refunds or incomplete orders by default, adjust the filter or aggregate logic to avoid overstating or misranking products.
Memory 3:
- Title: Confirm which metric defines "best‑selling" and explicitly sort by it
- Description: Before trusting top-N results, verify whether "best‑selling" refers to units or revenue and ensure the report is sorted descending on that metric.
- Content: Check the report's visible metric column (e.g., order quantity vs revenue), select the metric that matches the user's intent, and explicitly apply descending sort so the top rows truly represent the highest values for that metric.

						StaticText "I have a Fuji S5200 which I couldn't be more pleased with but wanted a camera that I could slip into my pocket, keep in the car or throw into my computer bag on business trips. I've owned the Z200fd for a little over 8 months now. I have used it in so many conditions: snow, rain, bright sun light, at the beach, in the desert, on a lake, landscapes, parties, concerts, fireworks, museums and for auction sites.The Fuji Film quality is unmatched. I've had film developers tell me that they rarely see such clear, high quality pictures. I've added a couple of pictures I took at a concert to a band's blog and they now use them on their website. Most of my friends ask to use my camera when taking photos at parties even though many people have a camera because of the quality of the pictures. I work for a Fortune 100 company and a couple of my pictures have been blown up to 18x24 and framed outside of our main customer conference room because of the crystal clear quality. Again, these were photos taken with the Z200fd and not with the entry level pro model S5200.Fuji cameras come with software and a USB connector that make uploading simple. You can buy a mini tripod that screws into to bottom of this camera and make this your camera of choice for every occasion. The camera comes with multiple settings for many of the situations I described above so you don't have to worry about aperture or low-light/backlight situations. It is very easy to use for the novice and a handy alternative for the pro."

						StaticText 'Ok,when I got this camera, I was super excited about it\'s sleek design...loved how you just slide the cover off to turn this on. I have had it almost 1 year when you day, my husband takes the camera to take a picture of our son in the snow. He goes to slide the cover off and it slid right off! We couldn\'t get it back on, like some sort of magnetic part was not holding it anymore or something. I called Fuji and was told to send it in with the date and proof of purchase since it was a few days shy of the 1 year warranty. I just checked on the status of the camera and Fuji wants $50 to repair the cover and I was told by the customer rep that this was not covered under "manufacturer\'s warranty". I asked her if that was not covered under the warranty than what was? She told me that only electrical components were covered. I argued with her that there is obviously some sort of manufacturer defect in the product since the lens cover just slid right off. I was basically told that there is a charge to fix the cover and that\'s that. I asked her that if this same thing happened after I had only had the camera week, would Fuji still not honor the warranty and she said "yes, I would still have to pay for it even if I had only had it for a week." What kind of customer service is this???? I asked to be forwarded to her supervisor and just shot off and email to him...let\'s see what the response is....I will update later. But honestly, if this the the kind of customer service that you get from Fuji, I would not buy another one of their product.'

# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One or several actions, separated by new lines.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
My memory says that I filled the first name and last name, but I can't see any
content in the form. I need to explore different ways to fill the form. Perhaps
the form is not visible yet or some fields are disabled. I need to replan.
</think>

<action>
fill('b534', 'Montre', True)
click('a51')
click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])
</action>
