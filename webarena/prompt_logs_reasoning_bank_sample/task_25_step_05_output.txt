I'll use the stored memories to format the result precisely and to ensure I search all review pages:
- Memory 1 (Review output format): Use — it instructs to include exact snippets, reviewer name, posting date, and review title plus a one-sentence summary. I'll follow that.
- Memory 2 (Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups): Use — it asks to provide verbatim snippets, attribution, and note whether pagination was exhausted; also offer to open full reviews or continue searching. I'll follow this and check next page(s).
- Memory 3 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): Use — it recommends using in-page search and looping through paginated review pages. I have found a match on the current page; I'll navigate to Page 2 to check for more matches.

Current findings from page 1: I found an explicit mention of "The print quality was an average." in the review titled "Never buying Epson again." by Roxanne Brandon Coffey (Posted on 4/20/23). I'll click the "Page 2" link to check the remaining reviews for any other mentions of "average" or "average print quality."
