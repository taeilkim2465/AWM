### LLM RESPONSE ###

Memory 1, 2, and 3 are all relevant — they all say to determine downvote-majority by inspecting each comment's displayed net score and counting negative scores. I will use those memories to count comments with negative net score once I can view the user's comments list.

I haven't yet opened the "Comments" tab on this user profile (the page currently shows Overview). Clicking the "Comments" tab should reveal the user's comment history and their per-comment net scores so I can count negatives. This is a different action from earlier attempts and moves toward the goal.
