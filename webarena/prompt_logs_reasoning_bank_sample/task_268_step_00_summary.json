I'll assume you mean official \"National Park\" units (the National Park Service parks with the \"National Park\" designation) unless you tell me to include all NPS sites; I'll state that assumption and offer the alternative.\n- Memory 3 (default origin): Use it — you didn't give a specific address, so I'll assume downtown Vinalhaven as the origin and state that.\n\nFirst I'll find Vinalhaven, ME on the map so I can look for nearby national parks and measure bike routes. I'll search the map for \"Vinalhaven, ME.\"",
