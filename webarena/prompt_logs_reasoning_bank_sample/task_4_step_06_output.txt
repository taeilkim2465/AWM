Memory check:
- Memory 1 (confirm which metric defines "best-selling" and the report's sort order): USE — I should verify the table uses "Order Quantity" (units) and ensure the table is sorted descending on that column before trusting the top entries.
- Memory 2 (confirm metric and explicitly sort results): USE — reinforces that I should click the "Order Quantity" column header to enforce a descending sort so the top rows reflect the top sellers.
- Memory 3 (check order-status and return/refund filters): USE — I should be mindful that cancelled/refunded orders might need excluding; the current filter panel doesn't show order-status here, so I'll proceed but note this to the user if they want strict finalized-sales filtering.

Plan: Click the "Order Quantity" column header to enforce sorting (element id 793), wait briefly for the table to update, then I will read the top rows and report back the top-3 products for January 2023.
