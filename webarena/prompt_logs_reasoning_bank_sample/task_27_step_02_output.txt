### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they directly describe the approach we need: check the author's comments (via their profile/activity page) and count comments with negative net scores. I will also keep Memory 3 in mind (do not fully rely on a single displayed score until I confirm what it represents), so I may verify on the profile or comment entries whether the shown score is the net score before counting negatives.

Next action: open the author profile for the user who made the latest post (Waoonet) by clicking their username link so I can find their comments/activity feed.
