### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: USE. It explains checking each comment's net score and counting negatives — that's exactly how to identify comments with more downvotes than upvotes.
Memory 2: USE. Confirms that a single numeric score is the net (upvotes minus downvotes) and negative values indicate downvote-majority — useful if the site shows one number per comment.
Memory 3: USE. Advises opening the author's profile/comments/activity page and handling pagination — we'll need the author's comment list to count across all pages.

Plan: First I need to find the "Space" forum and identify the latest post and its author. From the current page I'll navigate to the Forums listing to locate the Space forum. I'll start by clicking the "Forums" link.
