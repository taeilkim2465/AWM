The report currently shows an \"Order Quantity\" column (units sold), which matches a units-based \"best-selling\" definition — so I will enforce sorting on the Order Quantity column to make sure the top rows represent the highest unit sales.\n\nI will not use Memory 3 because this report UI does not show order-status/returns filters (only Period, From/To, Empty Rows). Since there is no option on this page to filter out cancelled/refunded orders, I will note that results may include those unless the system excludes them by default, but I cannot change that from here.\n\nPlanned action: click the \"Order Quantity\" column header to enforce a descending sort (so the top rows are the highest-selling products), then wait briefly for the table to update.",
