However I will verify the museum location on the map before running directions.\n\nPlan:\n1. Locate the Carnegie Art Museum on the map by refining the search query (include street address).\n2. Open the directions/find route tool and check driving distances to candidate nearby international airports (e.g., LAX, SBA, maybe others) using the directions panel, and capture the full address strings displayed for each airport.\nFirst step: re-run the search with a more specific query so the map can find the museum.",
