It reminds me to report assumptions (route type, traffic) when giving times.\n\nMemory 2: Use the directions panel to get driving distance and the formatted address — I will use this. The page already shows a directions panel with distances/times that I should read.\n\nMemory 3: Use the page's directions/map routing tool for driving-distance requests — I will use this. I should switch the directions mode to driving (car) on this map and get the driving time from the directions panel.\n\nPlanned effect of the next action: switching the routing mode to \"Car (OSRM)\" and clicking \"Go\" will replace the current walking directions with driving directions, updating the Directions panel to show driving distance and estimated time (which I will then read and compare to the walking time already shown: Distance 1.2 km, Time 0:16).",
