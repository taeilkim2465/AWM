Memory check:
- Memory 1 (Count comments with more downvotes than upvotes by checking net scores): USE — this directly describes the method to identify comments with more downvotes than upvotes by inspecting net scores.
- Memory 2 (Determine downvote-majority by checking a comment's net score): USE — same method, reinforces that negative net score indicates more downvotes.
- Memory 3 (Count negative net scores as downvote-majority): USE — concrete counting rule I'll apply when viewing the user's comments.

Plan: The latest post on the page is "PsBattle: Halloween Costume" submitted by OCDGaming (the top listing). I'll open the submitter's username link to go to their profile/page where their comments or activity can be listed, so I can inspect their comments and count those with negative net scores.
