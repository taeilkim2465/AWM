Memory 1: I will use this. It instructs the output format I should follow (exact review snippets, reviewer name, posting date, review title, and a one-sentence summary). 
Memory 2: I will use this. It reminds me to include verbatim snippets and attribution and to indicate whether the search covered all review pages and offer follow-ups.
Memory 3: I will use this. It recommends searching each reviews page (pagination). I'm currently on page 2 of reviews, so I should open page 1 and scan those reviews as well to be comprehensive.

Plan: open Page 1 of reviews to inspect all reviews for any mentions about "average print quality" (or similar phrasing about average/print quality). I'll extract exact snippets that mention quality or "average" and record reviewer name, post date, and review title. If none explicitly mention "average print quality", I'll report that and include the closest matches (snippets mentioning print quality) from the reviews I find and note which pages were searched.
