Memory 1: Use. It says to inspect each comment's net score and count negatives — that's the direct method to identify comments with more downvotes than upvotes.

Memory 2: Use. It clarifies that a single numeric score is typically net upvotes minus downvotes, so negative numbers mean downvote-majority. That will simplify counting.

Memory 3: Use. It reminds me to open the author's profile, check their comments/activity, and handle pagination or "load more" to ensure I count all comments.

Plan: First I'll open the Forums page to find the DIY forum and its latest post (so I can get the author). From there I'll open the author's profile and go to their comments/activity tab to count comments with negative net scores, handling pagination if needed.
