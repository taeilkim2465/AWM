It matches the user's request to capture driving distance/time and the full address string from the mapping interface.\n\nMemory 2: Use the page's directions/map tool to get travel distance and time — I will use this as well, since I should compute driving distances from Carnegie Art Museum to candidate airports using the site’s directions feature.\n\nMemory 3: Default origin and how to report driving distance — I will NOT use this memory now because an explicit origin (Carnegie Art Museum 800 Hobson Way Oxnard CA 93030) is already filled in the directions panel.\n\nCurrent plan: Close the \"Welcome to OpenStreetMap!\" dialog that is blocking the directions panel, so I can view the directions results and proceed to test airports for driving distance <= 30 km.",
