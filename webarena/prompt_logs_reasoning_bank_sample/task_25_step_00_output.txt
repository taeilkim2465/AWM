Memory check:
- Memory 1 (Review output format): I will use this — it tells me to include exact review snippets, reviewer name, posting date, and review title and to finish with a one-sentence summary. I'll follow it.
- Memory 2 (Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups): I will use this — it instructs to include verbatim snippets, attribution, and note whether we've checked all review pages and to offer to open full reviews or continue searching. I'll follow it.
- Memory 3 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): I will use this — it recommends using in-page search and iterating through paginated review pages and recording page numbers. I will start by opening the Reviews section and then search for the keyword "average print quality" (and possible variants) across all review pages.

Next action: open the Reviews section so I can search the reviews for mentions of "average print quality".
