Memory 1 (Confirm metric & sort): I will use this. The table shows an "Order Quantity" column, so I'll confirm the report is using that metric and ensure the results are sorted descending after the report loads.

Memory 2 (Prefer built-in Quarter grouping): I will NOT use this directly because the "Period" control only shows Day/Month/Year (no Quarter). I'll instead set the date range to cover Q1 2022 (2022-01-01 to 2022-03-31) so the report covers the quarter.

Memory 3 (Check order-status/refund filters): I will use this — I'll look for order-status or returns filters after the report loads and confirm defaults (or adjust if available). If no such filter is available on this page, I'll proceed with the default report.

Now I'll set the date range to Q1 2022 and run the report.
