### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: Use — it tells me to determine downvote-majority comments by inspecting each comment's displayed net score.
Memory 2: Use — it confirms that a single numeric score per comment is the net (upvotes minus downvotes), so negative values indicate more downvotes.
Memory 3: Use — it advises to traverse the user's comment/activity page and handle pagination or lazy loading, so I should scroll to load any additional comments.

Plan: I'll scroll down the user's Comments page to ensure all comments on this page are loaded (and trigger any lazy loading). Then I'll read the scores and count how many are negative (net < 0). If more content appears, I may need to scroll further or look for pagination controls.
