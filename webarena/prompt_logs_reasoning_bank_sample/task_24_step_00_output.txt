### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: I will use this. It tells me to report exact quotes, reviewer name, date, and offer follow-ups — helpful for the user's request.
Memory 2: I will use this. It recommends searching reviews by keyword and exhausting pagination, which I should do after opening the reviews.
Memory 3: I will use this. It suggests jumping to the review section and using in-page find/scrolling, which is the immediate next step.

Next action: open the reviews section so I can search the reviews text for mentions of the price being unfair (keywords like "price", "expensive", "overpriced", "not worth", "too expensive", "unfair"). I'll click the "2 Reviews" link to reveal the reviews.
