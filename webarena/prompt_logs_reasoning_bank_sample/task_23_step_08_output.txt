Memory 1: Use it. It instructs to include verbatim snippets, reviewer name, date, and note whether search covered all pages — I'll follow this when reporting results.

Memory 2: Use it. It says to search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination. I'll follow that approach and check the other reviews page(s).

Memory 3: Not needed right now. Tie-breaking/export options are unnecessary for a simple keyword search, but I can offer refinements after collecting matches.

Plan: The current page is Reviews page 2. I'll navigate to Page 1 of reviews to scan the remaining reviews for mentions of "fingerprint", "fingerprints", "fingerprint resistant", "anti-fingerprint", or similar phrases.
