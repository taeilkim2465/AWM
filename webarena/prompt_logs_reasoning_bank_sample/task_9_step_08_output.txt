### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 (Use the directions panel and report full address): I will use this—it's exactly what the user requested (driving distances and the full address shown by the map directions panel).
Memory 2 (Use the page's directions/map tool to get travel distance and time): I will use this too—I'll fill the destination and read the route distance/time from the directions widget.
Memory 3 (Default origin = downtown if not given): I will NOT use this—an origin is already provided (Carnegie Art Museum 800 Hobson Way Oxnard CA 93030).

I already tried LAX in the "To" field but the directions result isn't visible yet in the current view. To determine which nearby airports are within 30 km driving distance, I'll test another nearby candidate airport now (Santa Barbara Municipal Airport) using the directions tool to get the driving distance and address from the directions panel.
