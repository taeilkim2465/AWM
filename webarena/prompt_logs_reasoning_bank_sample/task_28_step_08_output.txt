### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 (check net scores of each comment) — I will use this: we need to identify comments with negative net scores.
Memory 2 (open user's comment/activity page and handle pagination) — I will use this: I should open the author's profile or comments/activity tab and ensure I traverse all comment pages.
Memory 3 (open latest post author's profile) — I will use this first: from the latest post I need to locate and open the author's profile to access their comments.

Next I need to reveal the post metadata (author name) and controls on the page so I can click the author's profile. The page currently shows the post image; I'll scroll down to expose the author name and other details.
