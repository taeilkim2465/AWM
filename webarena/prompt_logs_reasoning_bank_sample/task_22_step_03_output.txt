### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 (tie-breaking and refinement options): Not relevant for this task (we're searching review text for mentions of "under water photo"), so I will not use it.

Memory 2 (order-status and return/refund filters): Not relevant — this is about orders/reports, not review text. I will not use it.

Memory 3 (which metric defines "best‑selling"): Not relevant here either. I will not use it.

Plan: I need to search the customer reviews on this product page for any reviewer who mentions "under water", "underwater", or "under water photo". The page shows the Reviews section; I'll scroll down through the reviews to expose more review text and look for those keywords.
