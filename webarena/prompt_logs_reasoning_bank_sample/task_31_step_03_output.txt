### LLM RESPONSE ###

I will use the memories about counting comments with negative net scores because they directly describe how to identify comments with more downvotes than upvotes (a negative displayed score). They will be applied later when I inspect the user's comments.

- Use Memory 1? Yes — it outlines checking each comment's net score and counting negatives.
- Use Memory 2? Yes — it reiterates that a negative net score indicates more downvotes.
- Use Memory 3? Yes — same guidance; I'll follow this when counting.

Next I need to find the photoshopbattles forum in the forum list. To make that easier I'll switch the forum list to alphabetical order so I can locate "photoshopbattles" (which should appear under P). I'll click the "Alphabetical" navigation link to reorder the list.
