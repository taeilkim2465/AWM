First set \"From\" = \"Niagara Falls, NY, USA\" (the origin). Then request routes to candidate US international airports near Niagara Falls, starting with \"Buffalo Niagara International Airport\" and then \"Niagara Falls International Airport\". For each I'll click Go and read the directions panel results (distance, time, and the full address shown). That will tell whether each airport is within 60 km driving distance.\n\nNow I'll set the origin and request directions to Buffalo Niagara International Airport.",
