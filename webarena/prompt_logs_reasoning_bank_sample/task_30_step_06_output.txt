Memory 1: Use — it reminds me to treat each comment's displayed score as the net score and count negatives.
Memory 2: Use — it confirms that a single numeric score per comment indicates net upvotes minus downvotes, so negative values mean downvote-majority.
Memory 3: Use — it reminds me to check for pagination or "load more". I inspected the comments list on the page and there are no negative numeric scores visible and no "load more"/pagination controls in the sidebar; the page appears to show the user's comment history currently available.

Based on the visible comments on this user's comment page (I scrolled through the list), none of the comments show a negative net score.
