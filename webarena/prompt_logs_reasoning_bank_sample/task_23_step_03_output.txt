 I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2.
 - Memory 1: YES — I'll report verbatim snippets, reviewer name and date for any matches and note if the search covered all review pages.
 - Memory 2: YES — I'll check the current reviews and then exhaust pagination (go to page 2) to find any other matches.
 - Memory 3: NO — tie-breaking or export options aren't needed right now.

From the visible reviews on page 1 I already see matches mentioning fingerprint resistance:
 - Review by Rachel (Posted on 4/18/23): "It is super clear and fingerprint resistant..."
 - Review by T. Gannon (Posted on 4/18/23): "it does seem to resist fingerprints and stay cleaner..."

I'll navigate to Page 2 to continue the keyword search for any more reviewers who mention fingerprint/fingerprint resistant.
