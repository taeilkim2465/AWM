Memory 1: "Report reviewer findings precisely..." — I will NOT use this now. It's about quoting reviewers on review pages; we're just listing recent issues, not extracting reviewer comments.

Memory 2: "Offer clear follow-up options..." — I WILL use this. After I open the most recent issue(s) I'll offer options (e.g., open more issues, list titles, export, or open full issue details) so you can direct the next step.

Memory 3: "Exhaustive product-page review scan" — I will NOT use this. It's specific to scanning paginated product reviews and isn't relevant to browsing the project's issue list.

Plan: open the top (most recent) open issue from the list to view its details so I can report back the title, author, labels, and any recent activity. Then I'll offer follow-up choices per Memory 2.
