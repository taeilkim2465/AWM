The panel already shows the driving result (Distance: 1.2 km, Time: 0:02) which I'll record.\n\nMemory 3: Use the page's directions/map routing tool for driving-distance requests — I will use this. To compare walking vs driving, I'll switch the route mode to \"Foot (OSRM)\" on the page and get the walking time from the directions panel.\n\nNow I'll switch the route mode to Foot (OSRM) and request directions so I can read the walking time.",
