### LLM RESPONSE ###

I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they both say to confirm which metric defines "best-selling" (units vs revenue) and ensure the table is sorted descending on that metric before trusting the top entries. The report currently shows an "Order Quantity" column (units sold), which matches a units-based "best-selling" definition — so I will enforce sorting on the Order Quantity column to make sure the top rows represent the highest unit sales.

I will not use Memory 3 because this report UI does not show order-status/returns filters (only Period, From/To, Empty Rows). Since there is no option on this page to filter out cancelled/refunded orders, I will note that results may include those unless the system excludes them by default, but I cannot change that from here.

Planned action: click the "Order Quantity" column header to enforce a descending sort (so the top rows are the highest-selling products), then wait briefly for the table to update.
