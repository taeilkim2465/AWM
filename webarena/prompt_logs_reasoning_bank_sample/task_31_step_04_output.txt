### LLM RESPONSE ###

Memory 1: Relevant — it instructs to count comments with more downvotes than upvotes by checking net scores. I will use this as the counting method.
Memory 2: Relevant — reiterates that a negative displayed score indicates more downvotes; I will use this to identify which comments count.
Memory 3: Relevant — same guidance about treating negative net scores as downvote-majority; I will use it to keep counting consistent.

Plan: Open the photoshopbattles forum page (link is visible in the All forums list). From there I'll find the latest post in that forum, open it, identify the user who made that latest post, navigate to that user's profile or comment history, and then count the user's comments that show a negative net score. First step: open the photoshopbattles forum page.
