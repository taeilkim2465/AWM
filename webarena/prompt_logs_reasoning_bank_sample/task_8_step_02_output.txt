### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 (default origin): I will NOT use this — I already have Carnegie Mellon University as the origin on the page, so I don't need a default-city assumption.
Memory 2 (use the page's directions/map tool): I WILL use this — the OpenStreetMap directions widget can give road driving distance/time which is what the user asked for.
Memory 3 (cross-check with straight-line distance): I will NOT use this right now — first I'll get the driving distance; if needed I'll compute straight-line distances later.

I'll enter Carnegie Mellon University as the origin (to be sure) and then route to Pittsburgh International Airport to check its driving distance from CMU. If that distance is greater than 5 km, I'll try other nearby airports (e.g., Allegheny County Airport) the same way to verify whether any international airports lie within 5 km.
