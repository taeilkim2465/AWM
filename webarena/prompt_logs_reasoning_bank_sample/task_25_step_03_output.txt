I will use the memories as follows:
- Memory 1 (Review output format): USE — it instructs to present exact review snippets plus clear attribution and a concise summary; I'll follow that when reporting findings.
- Memory 2 (Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups): USE — it tells me to include exact quoted text, reviewer name, and date, and to state whether the search covered all review pages and offer to open full reviews or search more pages.
- Memory 3 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): USE — it advises to search across all review pages; I should check the next review page(s) to be comprehensive.

Next I'll open page 2 of the reviews to check for any other reviewers who mention "average print quality" (or similar wording) before reporting results.
