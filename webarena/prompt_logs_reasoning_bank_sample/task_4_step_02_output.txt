### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use the memories to make sure the report reflects the user's intent.

- Memory 1: Use. It reminds me to confirm which metric defines "best-selling" and that the table is sorted by that metric. The report shows an "Order Quantity" column which matches "units sold", so I'll enforce sorting on that column after running the report.
- Memory 2: Use. It repeats the need to explicitly set the metric and sort descending; I'll set Period to Month and then sort by Order Quantity descending so the top rows are the top sellers by units.
- Memory 3: Use. It warns about excluding cancelled/refunded orders. I'll check filters or the report options after loading results and, if needed, adjust order-status/returns filters (if available). For now I'll run the report for Jan 2023 and then inspect filtering options if results look unexpected.

Planned actions:
1. Change Period to "Month".
2. Set From = 01/01/2023 and To = 01/31/2023 to cover January 2023.
3. Click "Show Report".
4. Click the "Order Quantity" column header to ensure results are sorted descending by units sold.

I'll perform those actions now.
