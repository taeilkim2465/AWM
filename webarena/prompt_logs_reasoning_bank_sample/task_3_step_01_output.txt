### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use all three memory items:

- Memory 1 (confirm metric and sort): Use — I need to verify whether "best-selling" is by quantity or by revenue and ensure the report is sorted by that metric.
- Memory 2 (order-status and returns filters): Use — I should check filters so cancelled/refunded/draft orders are excluded for finalized 2022 sales.
- Memory 3 (use built-in aggregation and period granularity): Use — I will open the Bestsellers report and set the period to Year = 2022 so the report does the aggregation.

Next I will open the full "Bestsellers" report from the Reports menu to access filters (period, order status) and sorting controls.
