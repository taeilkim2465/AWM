If you instead want best-selling by revenue, the ranking changes (by revenue the top two would be: Cruise Dual Analog Watch (4 × $55 = $220) and Sprite Stasis Ball 65 cm (4 × $27 = $108)).\\n- I did not modify order-status or refund filters; if you want to exclude cancelled/refunded orders, tell me and I will adjust filters or refresh the report.\\n\\nWould you like me to: (A) break the tie by revenue for a strict top-2, (B) apply filters to exclude refunds/cancellations, or (C) export the report (CSV/Excel)?\")",

  "think": "Memory 1 (Confirm metric & sort): I will use this. The table shows an \"Order Quantity\" column and the rows are listed with quantities (5, 4, 4, 4, 3) so the report is using units sold. I should note that if you want \"best-selling\" by revenue instead, the top results change.\n\nMemory 2 (Check order-status and returns): I will mention this but did NOT change any order-status/refund filters on the page. The UI doesn't show explicit order-status filters here, so results likely reflect the report's defaults. If you need exclusions (cancelled/refunded), I should apply additional filters or ask you to confirm.\n\nMemory 3 (Use built-in aggregation/period): I will use this. The report period is set to \"Year\" with From 1/1/22 and To 12/31/22, so the table is aggregated for 2022.\n\nAction: report the top-2 based on Order Quantity (units). Also note the tie for second and offer tie-break options (by revenue or filter adjustments).",
