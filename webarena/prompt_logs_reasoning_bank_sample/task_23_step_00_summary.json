I will capture verbatim snippets, reviewer name/date, and offer to open full reviews or continue searching further pages.\n- Memory 2 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): USE. I'll open the Reviews section and use find to look for keywords like \"fingerprint\", \"fingerprints\", \"finger print\", \"smudge\", \"oleophobic\", \"resist\", and iterate pages if there is pagination.\n- Memory 3 (Offer tie-breaking and refinement options): USE as needed after I collect matches — I will offer options to refine or export results.\n\nNext action: open the Reviews section on the product page to search the reviews for mentions of fingerprint resistance.",
