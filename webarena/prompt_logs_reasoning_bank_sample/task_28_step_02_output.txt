I will use the stored memories because they directly describe the steps I need:
- Memory 1: Use — it tells me to identify comments with negative net scores by checking displayed scores.
- Memory 2: Use — it reminds me to open the author's comment/activity page and handle pagination or "load more".
- Memory 3: Use — it instructs to go from the latest post to the author's profile to view their comments.

Next I need to open the Worcester forum page to find the latest post and its author. I'll click the "WorcesterMA" forum link on the current page.
