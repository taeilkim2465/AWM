### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use the stored memories to guide the review search.

- Memory 1 (Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups): USE. I will capture verbatim snippets, reviewer name/date, and offer to open full reviews or continue searching further pages.
- Memory 2 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): USE. I'll open the Reviews section and use find to look for keywords like "fingerprint", "fingerprints", "finger print", "smudge", "oleophobic", "resist", and iterate pages if there is pagination.
- Memory 3 (Offer tie-breaking and refinement options): USE as needed after I collect matches — I will offer options to refine or export results.

Next action: open the Reviews section on the product page to search the reviews for mentions of fingerprint resistance.
