### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 (confirm metric and sort order): I will use this — we must verify whether "best-selling" means units or revenue and ensure the report is sorted descending on that metric before trusting the top-3.

Memory 2 (confirm metric and explicitly sort results): I will use this as well — if the report shows both metrics or the wrong metric, I'll switch the metric or sort the appropriate column descending.

Memory 3 (order-status and returns/refund filters): I will use this — I need to make sure cancelled/refunded/draft orders are excluded so the rankings reflect finalized sales.

Next action: open the Reports section to find the Bestsellers report where I can set the date range to January 2023 and adjust metric/sort and order-status filters.
