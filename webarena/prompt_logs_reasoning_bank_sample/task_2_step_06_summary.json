  "think": "I will use the memory items as follows before taking actions:\n\n- Memory 1 (Confirm metric and sort): Use. It reminds me to ensure \"best-selling\" is measured by Order Quantity (not revenue) and to sort by that column. The report shows an \"Order Quantity\" column, so I should sort that column to find the top seller.  \n- Memory 2 (Prefer built-in aggregation / Quarter): Use partially. The report supports Period grouping (Day / Month / Year) but not Quarter directly. I'll change the Period to \"Month\" so the report can better aggregate across the Q1 date range (Jan 1–Mar 31) and then refresh the report. That should help get aggregated totals per product across the period.  \n- Memory 3 (Check order-status / returns): Not used right now because there are no visible order-status or returns filters on this page; I'll rely on the report's defaults for finalized sales unless you want me to look for additional filters.\n\nNext I'll change the Period to \"Month\", refresh the report (Show Report), then sort the table by the \"Order Quantity\" column so the top row reflects the product with the highest quantity sold in the selected Q1 date range.",
