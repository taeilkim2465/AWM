I will use the saved memories as follows:
- Memory 1 (Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups): USE — I will return verbatim snippets with reviewer name and date and offer to fetch more context or continue searching.
- Memory 2 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): USE — I will check all review pages for the keyword(s) so the search is comprehensive.
- Memory 3 (Offer tie-breaking and refinement options): PARTIALLY USE — I will offer follow-ups such as searching other keywords or exporting results if needed.

Current page shows Reviews page 2 (of 2) with two reviews visible; I do not see any mention of "fingerprint" or "fingerprint resistant" in the visible text. To be thorough I need to check the other review page (Page 1) for mentions of "fingerprint" or similar words.
I will navigate to Page 1 now so I can scan those reviews for the keyword(s).
