I will consider the three memory items before acting.

- Memory 1 (report reviewer findings precisely): Not relevant for this step — the user asked to check recent open issues, not to extract reviewer quotes. I will not use this memory now.
- Memory 2 (offer clear follow-up options): Relevant — after listing recent issues I should offer clear next actions (open an issue, view more, change sort, export). I will use this.
- Memory 3 (exhaustive product-page review scan): Not relevant — this concerns scanning paginated product reviews; here we only need to surface the most recent open issues on the issues page.

Next I will report the most recent open issues visible on the page and offer follow-up actions.
