This matches the visible UI which shows a single score per comment.\nMemory 2: Use — it clarifies that a single numeric score is the net score, and negative values indicate more downvotes than upvotes. We'll treat negative scores as the criterion.\nMemory 3: Use — it reminds to handle pagination or lazy-loading when counting all comments. I need to scroll or load more comments to ensure I check the full comment list for this user.\n\nNext action: scroll down to load more of the user's comments so I can inspect all comment scores (and then count how many have negative net scores).",
