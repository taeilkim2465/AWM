I will consider the memory items:\n\n- Memory 1 (use directions/map tool for travel distance): Not needed — the user only asked to find the page of the place on the map, not travel distances.\n- Memory 2 (resolve place-identity ambiguities using common associations): Use this — Mr. Rogers is most commonly associated with WQED in Pittsburgh, which matches the current search result. I'll proceed assuming the user means the WQED studio; I'll note that choice and can refine if they meant a different location.\n- Memory 3 (search reviews systematically): Not needed — irrelevant for finding the place page.\n\nNext I need to open the place page for Studio WQED from the search results. I'll click the search-result link (OpenStreetMap Nominatim results area) to view the place details.",
