Memory 1: Use it. It tells me to check each comment's displayed score (net upvotes minus downvotes) and count negatives — that's the simplest way to determine if a comment has more downvotes than upvotes on this page.

Memory 2: Use it. It reminds me to handle pagination / lazy loading. I should scroll further to load more of the author's comments to ensure I inspect them all (or at least all currently accessible comments on this page).

Memory 3: Partially use. It suggested opening the latest post author's profile to view their comments. I'm already viewing comments by the latest post author (InternationalBack472) in the right-hand content area, so I don't need to click the profile again now.

Plan: Scroll down to load more of the author's comments and then inspect the visible score numbers for any negative values (net score < 0). I'll scroll now to load more comments.
