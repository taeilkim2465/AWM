### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use the memory items:
- Memory 1: Use it — it recommends using the repository's Issues search box to filter by label, which is the fastest approach here.
- Memory 2: Use it — it specifically advises entering a label-based search query in the issues search input.
- Memory 3: Use it — suggests broadening to related labels if needed; I'll include both "help wanted" and "good first issue" in the filter to catch related help-opportunities.

Plan: fill the Issues search box with a label-based query for labels related to "help needed" (help wanted + good first issue) and submit the search.
