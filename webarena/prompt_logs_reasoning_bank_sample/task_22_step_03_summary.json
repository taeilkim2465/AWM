I will not use it.\n\nMemory 3 (which metric defines \"best‑selling\"): Not relevant here either. I will not use it.\n\nPlan: I need to search the customer reviews on this product page for any reviewer who mentions \"under water\", \"underwater\", or \"under water photo\". The page shows the Reviews section; I'll scroll down through the reviews to expose more review text and look for those keywords.",
