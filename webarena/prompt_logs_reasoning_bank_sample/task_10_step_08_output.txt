I will use the stored memories because they match the needed method:
- Memory 1: Use it — it instructs to use the directions panel to get driving distances and the full address string from the mapping interface; that's exactly what I need.
- Memory 2: Use it — it reminds me to report map address, route distance/time, and whether it meets the 60 km threshold (and to offer follow-ups); I'll collect the data and later report which airports are within 60 km.
- Memory 3: Use it — it says to fill the origin/destination in the site's directions widget and read route distance/time; I'll do that for each airport.

Plan: the page currently shows Niagara Falls International Airport (with its full address already visible). Next I'll query directions to Buffalo Niagara International Airport and then to Greater Rochester International Airport using the 'To' field and the "Go" button so I can capture the route distance/time and the full address strings shown by the map. I'll perform both queries now (each fill + Go), pausing briefly after each to let the directions panel update.
