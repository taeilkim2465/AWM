Then query Greater Rochester International Airport (ROC) the same way to determine if it falls within 60 km. (Niagara Falls International Airport (IAG) is already shown on the page with Distance: 10 km and the full address in the 'To' field.)\n\nNow I'll run the two direction queries in sequence.",
