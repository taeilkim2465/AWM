### LLM RESPONSE ###

Memory 1: Use it — the user specified Carnegie Mellon University, so I'll use CMU as the origin (not a downtown default) and will state that assumption in results.
Memory 2: Use it — I'll use the page's directions/map tool to obtain driving distances and times between CMU and candidate airports.
Memory 3: Do not use right now — cross-checking straight-line distance isn't necessary unless the map routing results are inconclusive; I can use it later if needed.

Next I'll open the site's directions tool to enter CMU as the origin and search for nearby airports to measure driving distance.
