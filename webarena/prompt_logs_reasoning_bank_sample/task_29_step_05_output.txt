Memory 1 (check each comment's net score) — I will use this. It describes exactly how to determine which comments have more downvotes than upvotes by inspecting net scores and counting negatives.

Memory 2 (treat single numeric score as net score) — I will use this. The site shows a single number per comment (net score), so negative values indicate downvote-majority.

Memory 3 (open user's comment/activity page and handle pagination) — I will use this. I need to open the author's profile, go to their comments/activity tab, and make sure to load all comments (handle pagination or "load more") before counting.

Next I need to open the profile of the user who made the latest post on this DIY forum page (the top post is submitted by "Sorkill"), so I'll click that author link to view their profile/activity page.
