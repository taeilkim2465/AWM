Memory 1: Not using. It's about best‑selling metrics/sorting and isn't relevant to locating reviewers who mention small ear cups.
Memory 2: Not using. It's about order status/returns filters and not relevant to this review-text search.
Memory 3: Not using. It's the same theme as Memory 1 (sorting by a metric) and not relevant.

The reviews are already visible on the page; I can read them and extract reviewer names that mention ear cups being small or not fitting adult ears. I'll report those reviewers and short excerpts.
