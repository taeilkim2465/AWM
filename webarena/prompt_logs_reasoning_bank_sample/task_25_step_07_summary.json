I'll follow that format.\n- Memory 2 (Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups): Use — it instructs to provide verbatim snippets, attribution, and to say whether the search covered all review pages and offer to fetch more context. I'll include that and offer to open full reviews or continue searching.\n- Memory 3 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): Use — it instructs to search each review page. I'll click to go to Page 2 of reviews so I can check for additional mentions of \"average\" or \"average print quality\".\n\nNow I'll open page 2 of the reviews to continue the keyword search across all pages.",
