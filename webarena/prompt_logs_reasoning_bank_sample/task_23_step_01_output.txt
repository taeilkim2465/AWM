### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 because they instruct me to report reviewer snippets precisely (with attribution and date) and to search through all review pages by using in-page search and paginated navigation. I'll also keep Memory 3 in mind (offer refinements or exports) but I don't need to apply tie-breakers right now.

I can already see matches on the current page (page 1): Rachel's review ("It is super clear and fingerprint resistant...") and T. Gannon's review ("...it does seem to resist fingerprints and stay cleaner."). To be comprehensive I should check page 2 as well before listing the final results. I'll navigate to page 2 now.
