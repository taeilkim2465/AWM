This is directly relevant.\n\nMemory 2 (use profile/comment page and handle pagination) — I will use this. It reminds me to ensure we traverse all comments (pagination or lazy loading). I should scroll/load more to make sure I see every comment on this page.\n\nMemory 3 (open latest post author's profile) — I will use this as confirmation: we are already on the comments page for the latest post's author (InternationalBack472), so this memory confirms we're in the right place.\n\nNext action: scroll down the comments panel to load any remaining comments so I can count any comments with a negative score.",
