### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: "Confirm the metric and explicitly sort..." — Not relevant to this task (that memory is about sales metrics). I will not use it.
Memory 2: "Check order-status and return/refund filters" — Not relevant (about order reports). I will not use it.
Memory 3: Duplicate of Memory 1 (sorting metric) — Not relevant. I will not use it.

Plan: open the product reviews section so I can read each review and look for reviewers who mention the ear cups being small. I'll click the "12 Reviews" link near the rating to jump to the reviews.
