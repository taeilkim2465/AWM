### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I'll use the memories:
- Memory 1 (Review output format): Yes — I'll use it to present exact snippets, reviewer name, date, and a concise summary.
- Memory 2 (Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups): Yes — I'll include verbatim text, attribution, and note whether I've searched all review pages; I'll offer to continue searching if needed.
- Memory 3 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): Yes — I'll follow this and navigate the reviews pagination to check all pages for mentions of "average" or "average print quality".

Next step: navigate to Page 1 of the reviews so I can search the other reviews (we're currently on page 2). I'll click the "Page 1" link.
