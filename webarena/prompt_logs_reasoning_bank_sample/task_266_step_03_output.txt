Memory 1: Not using — it's about searching paginated reviews, irrelevant to finding the nearest national park.
Memory 2: Not using — same reason, about review searches/pagination.
Memory 3: Not using — also about paginated reviews and prompting the user, not relevant.

I need to find the nearest national park to Portland, Maine. The map is currently focused on Portland. I'll search the map for "Acadia National Park" (the likely candidate) to confirm location and distance from Portland.
