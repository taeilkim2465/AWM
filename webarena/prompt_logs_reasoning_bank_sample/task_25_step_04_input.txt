# Instructions

You are a UI Assistant, your goal is to help the user perform tasks using a web browser. You can
communicate with the user via a chat, in which the user gives you instructions and in which you
can send back messages. You have access to a web browser that both you and the user can see,
and with which only you can interact via specific commands.

Review the instructions from the user, the current state of the page and all other information
to find the best possible next action to accomplish your goal. Your answer will be interpreted
and executed by a program, make sure to follow the formatting instructions.

**Current Progress**: Step 4/10 (6 steps remaining)

**Before choosing your next action:**
- Check your action history below - are you repeating the same actions?
- If yes, try a different approach (search, different menu, filters, etc.)
- Make sure each action brings you closer to completing the goal

## Chat messages:

 - [assistant] Hi! I am your UI assistant, I can perform web tasks for you. What can I help you with?
 - [user] List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about average print quality# Reasoning Memories

Below are some memory items that I accumulated from past interaction from the environment that may be helpful to solve the task. You can use it when you feel it's relevant. In each step, please first explicitly discuss if you want to use each memory item or not, and then take action.

Memory 1:
- Title: Review output format
- Description: When reporting review findings, present exact review snippets plus clear attribution and a concise summary.
- Content: Include the exact quote(s) from reviews, the reviewer name, the posting date, and the review title (if available). Finish with a one-sentence summary stating whether the requested sentiment or claim (e.g., "price unfair") was found.
Memory 2:
- Title: Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups
- Description: When listing reviewers who mention a specific issue, provide verbatim snippets, attribution, and options to fetch more context.
- Content: Include the exact quoted text, reviewer name, and date (or page number) for each match and note whether the search covered all review pages; offer to open full reviews or continue searching further pages for more matches.
Memory 3:
- Title: Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination
- Description: When looking for reviewers who mention a specific detail, use in-page search and iterate through all paginated review pages.
- Content: Use the browser's find feature or a site search for the target keyword(s), and loop through each reviews page until no new matches appear; record which page each match came from so the search is comprehensive and reproducible.

						StaticText 'I\'m an Epson fan. Have owned multiple ones over the years. This is one of the fastest and easiest for small home office use. Here\'s are my ups and considerations to help you decide if its for you:Ups/Why I like it:-Easy, easy set up- Great quality printing with the option to get it faster or better qualtiy (admittedly my default is low quality, fast and B&W to save those color cartridge ink for when I need it.- Holds plenty of paper - in a real paper tray (instead of hanging over the back like some computers)- When I do print photos in color - they are incredibly crisp and clean- Multiple connection/printing options: Print from anywhere to it, print from your mobile to it, print with it connected wirelessly - or if the internet goes out - print from it connected by USB. I\'m pretty sure I haven\'t yet found every way you can print on this thing - but, I feel safe it\'s covered.- All the features an AIO needs -scan, fax, copy etc. They are there. They are easy to use and work like they should.The one caveat I always have about Epsons applies here. They tend to live by the "sell them cheap - and then make lots of $$$ for their life via very pricey printing ink refills". To get around this, I recommend:- Keep your default on B&W draft/fast for everyday printing,- don\'t always believe it when it tells you you\'re running out of ink (often there\'s plenty to go - and it will print with whatever cartridges have ink if you ask it to),- do a print test of a couple of a few pages before printing out a whole large document or multiple copies of larger documents, and always buy the cartridges with XL in them (T252XL not T252) - for about $10 more they will give you more than 3x the paper. (e.g. T252 = 300 pages, T252XL =1100pages). XL cartridges tend to run about $30 each.'

						StaticText "I purchased this printer in July 2015. The print heads have clogged up numerous times from very early on. It was used daily in a 1 person office. I found instructions online for unclogging print heads. The instructions took time, but were effective. However, over time this has become incredibly tedious to do on a regular basis. I can't tell you how much ink has been wasted (that's where the real expense lies with these printers) from unclogging print heads and running nozzle cleaning. In addition, the printer would often not recognize the (always genuine Epson) ink cartridges after the cleaning, so the ink would be wasted. I also have the WF-7620 and it has had the exact same problem. I purchased a WorkForce 610 in 2009 and it just died (early 2017). These newer Epsons barely worked for a month. Ridiculous!"

# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One or several actions, separated by new lines.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
My memory says that I filled the first name and last name, but I can't see any
content in the form. I need to explore different ways to fill the form. Perhaps
the form is not visible yet or some fields are disabled. I need to replan.

<action>
fill('b534', 'Montre', True)
click('a51')
click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])
