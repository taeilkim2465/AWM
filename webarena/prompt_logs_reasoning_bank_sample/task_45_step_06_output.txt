### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: "Report reviewer findings precisely..." — Not needed for this step. I'm just opening the Issues list to find the most recent open issues, so I won't use this memory now.

Memory 2: "Offer clear follow-up options..." — Partially relevant. After I show the list of recent open issues, I'll offer follow-up options (open an issue, filter by label, view full details). I won't apply it before navigating, but I'll use it after we see the issues.

Memory 3: "Exhaustive product-page review scan" — Not relevant here (it's about scanning product reviews). I'll not use it.

Plan: navigate to the repository's Issues list (left sidebar “Issues”) to view the most recent open issues. I'll click the Issues link in the project navigation.
