### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 (tie-breaking and refinement options): Not relevant to finding reviewers mentioning underwater photos, so I will not use it.
Memory 2 (order-status and return/refund filters): Not relevant to this product review lookup, so I will not use it.
Memory 3 (confirm metric for "best-selling"): Not relevant.

Current page shows Reviews and indicates "You're currently reading page 2" (AX tree). To find reviewers who mention "under water" or "underwater" I need to check all review pages. The page navigation includes a "Page Previous" link (bid '2183') that should go to page 1 where other reviews are. I'll navigate to the previous page to read more reviews and search for any mention of underwater photos.
