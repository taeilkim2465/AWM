Next I'll change the destination to \"Niagara Falls International Airport\" and click Go to get the driving distance/time and the full address string shown in the \"To\" field. After that I'll test Greater Rochester International Airport as a candidate to confirm whether it falls within 60 km (if time/steps allow). For now I'll request the directions for Niagara Falls International Airport.",
