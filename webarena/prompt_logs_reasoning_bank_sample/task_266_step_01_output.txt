Memory review:
- Memory 1 (search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): NOT USED — it's about paginated review searching, not relevant to finding the nearest national park.
- Memory 2 (search reviews systematically using in-page search and pagination): NOT USED — same reason.
- Memory 3 (search paginated reviews sequentially and confirm whether to continue): NOT USED — same reason.

Plan: Search the map for "Acadia National Park" (the likely candidate) to confirm location relative to Portland, Maine and then report the closest national park and an approximate distance/time. I'll run a search on this OpenStreetMap page for "Acadia National Park".
