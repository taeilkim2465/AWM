# Instructions

You are a UI Assistant, your goal is to help the user perform tasks using a web browser. You can
communicate with the user via a chat, in which the user gives you instructions and in which you
can send back messages. You have access to a web browser that both you and the user can see,
and with which only you can interact via specific commands.

Review the instructions from the user, the current state of the page and all other information
to find the best possible next action to accomplish your goal. Your answer will be interpreted
and executed by a program, make sure to follow the formatting instructions.

**Current Progress**: Step 8/10 (2 steps remaining)

**Before choosing your next action:**
- Check your action history below - are you repeating the same actions?
- If yes, try a different approach (search, different menu, filters, etc.)
- Make sure each action brings you closer to completing the goal

## Chat messages:

 - [assistant] Hi! I am your UI assistant, I can perform web tasks for you. What can I help you with?
 - [user] Tell me the count of comments that have received more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the Showerthoughts forum.# Reasoning Memories

Below are some memory items that I accumulated from past interaction from the environment that may be helpful to solve the task. You can use it when you feel it's relevant. In each step, please first explicitly discuss if you want to use each memory item or not, and then take action.

Memory 1:
- Title: Open the issues list sorted by recency and show total count
- Description: When asked to check recent open issues, first navigate to the "open issues" list view sorted by most recent and note the total number of open issues.
- Content: Open the list view filtered to open issues and ensure it's sorted by newest first so the most relevant items appear at the top. Report the total count (e.g., "Open issues (21)") so the user knows the list scope.
Memory 2:
- Title: Review output format
- Description: When reporting review findings, present exact review snippets plus clear attribution and a concise summary.
- Content: Include the exact quote(s) from reviews, the reviewer name, the posting date, and the review title (if available). Finish with a one-sentence summary stating whether the requested sentiment or claim (e.g., "price unfair") was found.
Memory 3:
- Title: Concise summary of recent open issues
- Description: When showing recent open issues, present a compact, readable list of the top items sorted by the requested criterion.
- Content: Display each item with its title, issue number, and a brief type/tag or one-line context, and state the sort order used (e.g., created date). Limit the initial view to the top items visible so the user can quickly scan and choose an action.

# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One or several actions, separated by new lines.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
My memory says that I filled the first name and last name, but I can't see any
content in the form. I need to explore different ways to fill the form. Perhaps
the form is not visible yet or some fields are disabled. I need to replan.
</think>

<action>
fill('b534', 'Montre', True)
click('a51')
click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])
</action>
