  "think": "Memory 1: Use the page's origin if provided. I will use it — the directions widget already has \"Carnegie Mellon University, Tech Street, ... 15213\" as the origin, so I'll state that explicitly.\nMemory 2: Not needed for now — the user asked for driving-distance-based results, not straight-line distances.\nMemory 3: Use the page's directions/map tool to get road distances and times — I will use it. I already used the OpenStreetMap directions tool from CMU to Pittsburgh International Airport and it returned Distance: 33 km, Time: 0:32.\n\nPrevious actions filled the directions fields and ran the route: the directions pane shows one airport route (Pittsburgh International Airport) with 33 km driving distance. I did not find any other airport labeled \"International\" within 50 km driving on the map; I will report this finding and offer to search further if you want.",
