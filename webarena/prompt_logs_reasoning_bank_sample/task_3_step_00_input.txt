# Instructions

You are a UI Assistant, your goal is to help the user perform tasks using a web browser. You can
communicate with the user via a chat, in which the user gives you instructions and in which you
can send back messages. You have access to a web browser that both you and the user can see,
and with which only you can interact via specific commands.

Review the instructions from the user, the current state of the page and all other information
to find the best possible next action to accomplish your goal. Your answer will be interpreted
and executed by a program, make sure to follow the formatting instructions.

**Current Progress**: Step 0/10 (10 steps remaining)

**Before choosing your next action:**
- Check your action history below - are you repeating the same actions?
- If yes, try a different approach (search, different menu, filters, etc.)
- Make sure each action brings you closer to completing the goal

## Chat messages:

 - [assistant] Hi! I am your UI assistant, I can perform web tasks for you. What can I help you with?
 - [user] What are the top-2 best-selling product in 2022# Reasoning Memories

Below are some memory items that I accumulated from past interaction from the environment that may be helpful to solve the task. You can use it when you feel it's relevant. In each step, please first explicitly discuss if you want to use each memory item or not, and then take action.

Memory 1:
- Title: Confirm which metric defines "best-selling" and the report's sort order
- Description: Always verify whether "best-selling" is measured by units sold or by revenue and ensure the report is sorted by that metric.
- Content: Before trusting the top entry, explicitly check the report's metric column (e.g., order quantity vs sales value) and confirm the table is sorted descending on that column. If the UI doesn't clearly indicate the sort, click the column header or apply an explicit sort parameter so the top row really reflects the requested definition.
Memory 2:
- Title: Check order-status and return/refund filters
- Description: Make sure the report excludes cancelled, refunded, or draft orders unless those should count toward the best-seller metric.
- Content: Review and set filters for order status and returns so metrics reflect finalized sales only; if the report includes refunds or incomplete orders by default, adjust the filter or aggregate logic to avoid overstating or misranking products.
Memory 3:
- Title: Prefer built-in aggregation and appropriate period granularity
- Description: Use the report's grouping and period filters (e.g., Quarter) rather than manually summing monthly rows.
- Content: If the report supports grouping by brand or selecting "Quarter" as the period, use those controls to get pre-aggregated totals. Manually summing individual product rows is error-prone and unnecessary when the report can calculate top sellers by brand directly.

click('a51')
click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])


# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One or several actions, separated by new lines.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
My memory says that I filled the first name and last name, but I can't see any
content in the form. I need to explore different ways to fill the form. Perhaps
the form is not visible yet or some fields are disabled. I need to replan.
</think>

<action>
fill('b534', 'Montre', True)
click('a51')
click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])
</action>
