It suggests jumping to the review section and using in-page find/scrolling, which is the immediate next step.\n\nNext action: open the reviews section so I can search the reviews text for mentions of the price being unfair (keywords like \"price\", \"expensive\", \"overpriced\", \"not worth\", \"too expensive\", \"unfair\").
