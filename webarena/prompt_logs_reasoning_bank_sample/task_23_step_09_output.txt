Memory 1: I will use this — it asks to give verbatim snippets, reviewer name, date, and note whether the search covered all review pages.
Memory 2: I will use this partially — I used the page's visible reviews (page 1) and will note that I have not yet exhausted pagination (page 2 exists).
Memory 3: I will not actively use tie-breaking/export options right now, but I will offer the user follow-ups (search next page / open full reviews / export).
Now I'll report the matches found on the current review page and offer to continue searching page 2.
