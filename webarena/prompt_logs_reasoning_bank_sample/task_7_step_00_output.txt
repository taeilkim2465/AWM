### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I'll use Memory 3 (use the page's directions/map tool) because the user asked about driving distance, and the site's directions feature is the right way to get road distance and time. I will not rely on Memory 1 (default origin) because the user gave a specific origin: Carnegie Mellon University. I will not use Memory 2 (straight-line distance) for now — if the driving-route result is ambiguous or there are edge cases, I can compute or report straight-line distances as a cross-check later.

First I'll center the map on Carnegie Mellon University so I can find nearby airports and then use the directions tool to measure driving distances to candidate international airports (starting with Pittsburgh International Airport).
