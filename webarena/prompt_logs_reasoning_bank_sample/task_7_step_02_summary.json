So no need to default to a downtown location.\n\nMemory 2 (Cross-check with straight-line distance): I will NOT use this memory yet — the user asked about driving distance within 50 km, so road distance is primary. I can cross-check later if needed.\n\nMemory 3 (Use the page's directions/map tool): I WILL use this memory — the OpenStreetMap directions widget can give road distance and time, which is exactly what's needed to determine whether an airport is within 50 km driving distance.\n\nPlan: Use the directions widget with origin = Carnegie Mellon University and destination = Pittsburgh International Airport (and repeat for other candidate airports if any). First I will request a driving route to Pittsburgh International Airport.",
