Memory 1: I will use this — it tells me to count comments with negative net scores, which is the simplest way if the site shows net scores.
Memory 2: I will use this — it suggests opening the forum and the author's activity/comments page and handling pagination, which I'll need after opening the Showerthoughts forum and finding the latest post's author.
Memory 3: I will use this — I must verify whether the displayed score is a net score or separate up/down counts before relying on it.

Next step: open the Showerthoughts forum page so I can find the latest post and its author.
