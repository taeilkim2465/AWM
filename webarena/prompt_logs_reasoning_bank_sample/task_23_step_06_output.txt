### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 for this task and defer Memory 3 for now:
- Memory 1: Use — I'll report exact quoted snippets, reviewer name, and page info if matches are found.
- Memory 2: Use — I'll search through all review pages (pagination) for the keyword(s).
- Memory 3: Do not use right now — tie-breaking/export options aren't needed until we have results.

The reviews panel is currently on page 2 (showing two reviews). To check earlier reviews for mentions of "fingerprint", "fingerprints", or "fingerprint resistant", I need to open page 1 of the reviews.
