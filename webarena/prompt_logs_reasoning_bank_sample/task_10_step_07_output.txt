### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use the memories because they instruct to use the map/directions tool to get driving distances and to capture the full address string shown by the mapping interface (Memory 1, 2, 3). That fits the user's request to report full addresses of US international airports within 60 km driving distance of Niagara Falls.

Next, I need to get the directions result for Niagara Falls International Airport (IAG) so I can read the "To" field full address string and the directions panel distance/time to decide if it is within 60 km. The page currently shows Buffalo–Niagara International Airport (BUF). I'll replace the "To" field with "Niagara Falls International Airport" and run the directions query, then wait for the results to appear.
