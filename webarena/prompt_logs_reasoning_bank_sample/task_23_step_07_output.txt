### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2.

- Memory 1 (Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups): YES — I'll report verbatim snippets, reviewer name, date, and note which review page the match came from, and offer to fetch more context if needed.
- Memory 2 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): YES — I should check all review pages for the keyword(s) (e.g., "fingerprint", "fingerprints", "fingerprint resistant") so results are comprehensive.
- Memory 3 (tie-breaking/filters/exports): NOT needed right now.

Next I'll open the second page of reviews to search all pages for mentions of fingerprint resistance.
