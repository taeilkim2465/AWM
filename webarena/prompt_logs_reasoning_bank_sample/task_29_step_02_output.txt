Memory 1: Use — it describes checking each comment's displayed net score and counting negatives; that's exactly how I'll identify downvote-majority comments.
Memory 2: Use — it clarifies that a single numeric score is the net (upvotes minus downvotes), so negative scores mean more downvotes.
Memory 3: Use — it reminds me to open the author's profile, go to their comments/activity tab, and handle pagination/lazy-loading when counting.

Plan: find and open the DIY forum from the list of forums, open the latest post there, click the post author to go to their profile, then open their comments/activity, and count comments with negative net scores (checking all pages/load-more). First I need to reveal more of the forum list to find "DIY", so I'll scroll down further.
