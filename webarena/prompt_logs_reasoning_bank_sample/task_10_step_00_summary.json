  "think": "I will use the memories because they describe the exact approach the user asked for: using the map/directions tool to get driving distances and the full address strings for each candidate airport, and reporting whether each meets the 60 km driving-distance threshold.\n\n- Memory 1: Use — it tells me to get driving distances/times and the full address strings from the mapping directions panel. I'll follow that.\n- Memory 2: Use — it instructs how to present findings (address, distance/time, whether within threshold) and to offer follow-ups. I'll collect the info and will present it that way.\n- Memory 3: Use — it recommends filling the mapping site's directions widget to obtain road distance and time. I'll open the directions tool and run routes from Niagara Falls to candidate airports.\n\nPlan of action:\n1. Search and center the map on \"Niagara Falls, NY\" so the directions origin is correct.\n2. Open the \"Find directions between two points\" (directions) panel.\n3. Use the directions panel to get driving routes from Niagara Falls to each US airport candidate (e.g., Niagara Falls International Airport (IAG) and Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF)), read the route distance/time and the address strings shown for each, and determine whether each is within 60 km driving distance.\n\nFirst I'll search for Niagara Falls, NY and open the directions tool on the page.",
