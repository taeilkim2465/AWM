### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: Use primary navigation control to open the task list — I will use this (yes). The page shows a "To-Do List" primary navigation link with a count badge, so clicking it is the fastest way to surface the user's todos.

Memory 2: Give a concise top-N summary with follow-up options — I will not use this right now (no). I will first open the to-do list; after the list loads I'll use this memory to summarize the items.

Memory 3: Open task lists via primary navigation — I will use this (yes). It reinforces that clicking the main "To-Do List" navigation item is the correct next action.

Planned action: Click the "To-Do List" link in the primary navigation to open the user's to-dos.
