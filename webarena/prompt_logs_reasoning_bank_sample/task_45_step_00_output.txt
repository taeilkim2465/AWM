### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory review:
- Memory 1: Relevant — it tells me to open the issues list with the "Open" filter and sort by newest. I will use this.
- Memory 2: Relevant — it reminds me to note the total number of open issues. I will use this.
- Memory 3: Relevant — it suggests presenting a concise summary of the top recent open issues. I will use this.

Next step: navigate to the project's Issues page so I can apply the Open filter and sort by newest, then report the top items and the total count.
