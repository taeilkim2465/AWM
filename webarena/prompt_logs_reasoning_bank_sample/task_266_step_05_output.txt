Memory check:
- Memory 1 (search reviews by keyword): not relevant to this mapping/directions task — I will not use it.
- Memory 2 (search reviews systematically): not relevant — I will not use it.
- Memory 3 (paginate reviews and confirm): not relevant — I will not use it.

Plan: Use the directions form on this OpenStreetMap page to compute the route and distance from Portland, Maine (the largest city in Maine) to Acadia National Park to confirm it is the closest national park. I'll fill the "From" and "To" fields and click "Go".
