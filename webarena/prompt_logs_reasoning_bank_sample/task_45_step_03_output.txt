### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: "Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups" — I will not use this now (it's specific to reporting reviewer snippets, not relevant to simply listing recent open issues).

Memory 2: "Offer clear follow-up options after presenting matches" — I will plan to use this after I show the recent open issues (to offer actions like open an issue, view details, or filter). So mark as "will use later."

Memory 3: "Exhaustive product-page review scan" — not relevant now (it's about scanning product reviews). I will not use it.

Plan: navigate from this issue page to the project Issues list (List view) to see the most recent open issues. I'll click the "Issues → List" link in the project navigation.
