Memory review:
- Memory 1 (Use directions panel for proximity checks and report full details): I will use this — it matches the user's request to obtain driving distances and capture the full address strings shown by the mapping/directions tool.
- Memory 2 (Use the page's directions/map tool to get travel distance and time): I will use this — I should use the site's directions feature to compute driving distances from Carnegie Art Museum to candidate airports.
- Memory 3 (Default origin downtown when none given): I will NOT use this — the user specified Carnegie Art Museum as the origin, so I should use the museum's exact location rather than a default downtown.

Planned next action:
- Search this map for "Carnegie Art Museum Oxnard" to locate the museum on the map and enable directions from that point.
