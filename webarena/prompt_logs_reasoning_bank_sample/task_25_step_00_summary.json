I'll follow it.\n- Memory 2 (Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups): I will use this — it instructs to include verbatim snippets, attribution, and note whether we've checked all review pages and to offer to open full reviews or continue searching. I'll follow it.\n- Memory 3 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): I will use this — it recommends using in-page search and iterating through paginated review pages and recording page numbers. I will start by opening the Reviews section and then search for the keyword \"average print quality\" (and possible variants) across all review pages.\n\nNext action: open the Reviews section so I can search the reviews for mentions of \"average print quality\".",
