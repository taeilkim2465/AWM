It tells me to inspect each comment's displayed score and count negatives — that's how to identify comments with more downvotes than upvotes.\n- Memory 2 (treat a single numeric score as net score): I will use this. The site shows a single number per comment (net votes), so negative values mean downvote-majority.\n- Memory 3 (open author profile, comments/activity tab, handle pagination): I will use this. To count all of the user's comments I need to go to their profile and check their comments/activity, and be ready to page through if necessary.\n\nNext step:\nI need to go to the DIY forum (subreddit) page to find the latest post and its author. From the search results I can click the \"DIY\" link shown in the top result to open the DIY forum.",
