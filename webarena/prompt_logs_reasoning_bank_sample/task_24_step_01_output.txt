I'll use the memory items as follows:
- Memory 1 (Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups): YES — I will include verbatim snippets, reviewer name, date, note that I searched all review pages, and offer follow-ups.
- Memory 2 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): PARTIAL — the page shows "2 Reviews" and both are visible; I will note that I checked the visible/paginated reviews (2) on this page. If you want I can attempt a keyword search across the site or other pages.
- Memory 3 (Prefer direct page scanning and in-page search for review extraction): YES — I inspected the reviews section directly (both reviews are visible). No mention of price/unfair appears in either review.

Since all reviews (2) are visible on the Reviews tab and neither mentions price or fairness, I'll report that and include the exact snippets and attribution. I can continue searching other pages or run keyword searches if you want.
