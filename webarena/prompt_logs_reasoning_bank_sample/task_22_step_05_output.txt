Memory check:
- Memory 1 (tie-breaking / filters): Not relevant for finding reviewers who mention underwater photos. I will not use it.
- Memory 2 (order-status / refunds): Not relevant. I will not use it.
- Memory 3 (metric for "best‑selling"): Not relevant. I will not use it.

Goal: find reviewers who mention underwater photos. The current view shows page 2 of reviews. I should go to page 1 to read the other reviews (there are 12 total). I'll navigate to Page 1 to inspect earlier reviews for mentions of "under water", "underwater", "waterproof", "beach", "lake", etc.
