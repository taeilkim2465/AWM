### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory check:
- Memory 1 (use directions/map tool for travel distance): Not needed right now — the user asked to find the page of the filming place on the map, not to compute distances.
- Memory 2 (resolve place-identity ambiguities): I will use this. "Mr. Rogers" is commonly associated with the PBS show filmed at WQED in Pittsburgh, so I'll find the WQED / WQED-TV location page on the map.
- Memory 3 (search reviews): Not needed.

Previous attempt to open the OpenStreetMap/Nominatim result timed out; I will try scrolling to ensure the result is in view and then click its link to open the place page.
