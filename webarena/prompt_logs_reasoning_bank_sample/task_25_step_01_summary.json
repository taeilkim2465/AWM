I'll follow that format when reporting matches.\n- Memory 2 (Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups): USE — it reminds me to provide verbatim snippets, attribution, and note whether the search covered all review pages; I will offer to continue searching additional pages if needed.\n- Memory 3 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): USE — it recommends searching each review page; I'll navigate to page 2 of reviews to continue the search for mentions of \"average print quality\" (or similar phrasing).\n\nPlan: start by moving to page 2 of reviews and then scan that page for the keyword \"average\" or other mentions of \"average print quality.\" I'll click the \"Page 2\" link now.",
