Memory 1: Use it. It reminds me to inspect each comment's displayed net score and count those with negative scores — directly relevant.
Memory 2: Use it. The page shows a single numeric score per comment (net score), so negative numbers indicate more downvotes than upvotes.
Memory 3: Use it. It suggests using the user's comments/activity page and handling pagination — I should open the author's profile "Comments" tab to see all their comments and look for pagination or "load more".

Next step: open the user's "Comments" tab on their profile to list all comments and check the displayed scores. I'll click the "Comments" tab.
