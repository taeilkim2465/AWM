### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to verify the metric and ensure the table is sorted by that metric (order quantity vs revenue) before trusting the top entries. Memory 3 (check order-status/refunds) is relevant but I don't see an order-status or returns filter on this Bestsellers report UI, so I will not apply it right now; I can revisit if you want to exclude cancelled/refunded orders.

Plan: click the "Order Quantity" column header to enforce a descending sort so the top rows represent the best-selling products by units sold for Jan 2023, then I'll read the top 3 products.
