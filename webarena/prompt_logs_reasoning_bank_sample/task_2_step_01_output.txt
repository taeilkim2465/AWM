### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use all three memory items:

- Memory 1: Use it. I need to confirm whether "best-selling" is by units or revenue and ensure the report is sorted by that metric.
- Memory 2: Use it. I should use the report's period/grouping controls to set the period to Quarter and select Q1 2022 rather than summing months manually.
- Memory 3: Use it. I should check filters for order status and refunds so the metric reflects finalized sales only.

Next I'll open the Reports > Products > Bestsellers report so I can inspect and set the metric, period (Quarter = Q1 2022), and order-status/refund filters.
