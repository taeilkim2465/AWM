It tells me to capture driving distance/time and the full address string from the directions panel; that's exactly what the user asked for.\nMemory 2: Use it — yes. It instructs to use the page's directions/map tool to get road distance and drive time for \"closest\" places.\nMemory 3: Do not use — the user provided an origin (Carnegie Art Museum), so I don't need a default origin.\n\nPrevious actions filled the \"From\" and \"To\" fields (To = Los Angeles International Airport) but I don't see the route results yet. Next I'll run the directions query so the map/directions panel can display the driving distance, time, and the full address string for LAX. After that I'll repeat for other nearby international airports and keep only those within 30 km driving distance.",
