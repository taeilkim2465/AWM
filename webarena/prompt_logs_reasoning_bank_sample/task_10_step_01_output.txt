Memory check:
- Memory 1 (use directions panel for proximity checks and report full details): I will use this — the page has a directions widget and I will extract driving distance/time and the full address string from it.
- Memory 2 (report map-address, route distance/time, and whether it meets the threshold): I will use this as the reporting format after obtaining each route from the map.
- Memory 3 (use the page's directions/map tool to get travel distance and time): I will use this — it tells me to fill the origin and destination fields and read the resulting route distance and time.

Plan: Use the directions panel on this OpenStreetMap page. First set "From" = "Niagara Falls, NY, USA" (the origin). Then request routes to candidate US international airports near Niagara Falls, starting with "Buffalo Niagara International Airport" and then "Niagara Falls International Airport". For each I'll click Go and read the directions panel results (distance, time, and the full address shown). That will tell whether each airport is within 60 km driving distance.

Now I'll set the origin and request directions to Buffalo Niagara International Airport.
