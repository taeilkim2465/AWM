Memory 1: Use it — it's relevant (using the Issues search box is the fastest way). The page already has a label-based query in the search box, so this memory applies.
Memory 2: Use it — same idea (apply a label-based search). The current search value already matches the desired query (label:"help wanted" OR label:"good first issue"), so I'll rely on the page results.
Memory 3: Use it if needed — if the visible results look sparse I should broaden or combine labels; I'll note this option for the user.

I'll extract the issues visible on the current filtered results that have either the "help wanted" or "good first issue" labels and report them. I won't change the page right now.
