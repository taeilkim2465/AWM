# Instructions

You are a UI Assistant, your goal is to help the user perform tasks using a web browser. You can
communicate with the user via a chat, in which the user gives you instructions and in which you
can send back messages. You have access to a web browser that both you and the user can see,
and with which only you can interact via specific commands.

Review the instructions from the user, the current state of the page and all other information
to find the best possible next action to accomplish your goal. Your answer will be interpreted
and executed by a program, make sure to follow the formatting instructions.

**Current Progress**: Step 0/10 (10 steps remaining)

**Before choosing your next action:**
- Check your action history below - are you repeating the same actions?
- If yes, try a different approach (search, different menu, filters, etc.)
- Make sure each action brings you closer to completing the goal

## Chat messages:

 - [assistant] Hi! I am your UI assistant, I can perform web tasks for you. What can I help you with?
 - [user] List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about under water photo# Reasoning Memories

Below are some memory items that I accumulated from past interaction from the environment that may be helpful to solve the task. You can use it when you feel it's relevant. In each step, please first explicitly discuss if you want to use each memory item or not, and then take action.

Memory 1:
- Title: Offer tie-breaking and refinement options (filters and exports)
- Description: When results tie or the user needs a different interpretation, present clear refinement options like tie-breakers, exclusion filters, or exporting the data.
- Content: If multiple items tie, offer to break ties using a secondary metric (e.g., revenue), or apply filters such as excluding refunded/cancelled orders. Also offer to export the filtered report (CSV/Excel) so the user can examine or sort the data further.
Memory 2:
- Title: Check order-status and return/refund filters
- Description: Make sure the report excludes cancelled, refunded, or draft orders unless those should count toward the best-seller metric.
- Content: Review and set filters for order status and returns so metrics reflect finalized sales only; if the report includes refunds or incomplete orders by default, adjust the filter or aggregate logic to avoid overstating or misranking products.
Memory 3:
- Title: Confirm which metric defines "best‑selling" and explicitly sort by it
- Description: Before trusting top-N results, verify whether "best‑selling" refers to units or revenue and ensure the report is sorted descending on that metric.
- Content: Check the report's visible metric column (e.g., order quantity vs revenue), select the metric that matches the user's intent, and explicitly apply descending sort so the top rows truly represent the highest values for that metric.

Despite being only 20.0mm thick, the 10-megapixel FinePix Z200fd touts cutting-edge technology and advanced features including a Fujinon 5x optical zoom lens, a high-resolution, scratch-resistant 2.7-inch LCD and sensitivity settings of up to ISO 1600 that enable partygoers to take beautiful, natural-looking images without flash, retaining the atmosphere of twilight and late-night events. Featuring Fujifilm’s acclaimed Face Detection Technology, now working in tandem with automatic red-eye removal, the FinePix Z200fd makes it easy to capture your friends’ good sides. At the press of a button, this mode identifies up to 10 human faces in a scene, and sets the correct focus and exposure, regardless of where subjects are located within the frame. The FinePix Z200fd then instantly checks each detected face for red eye and, if found, corrects it automatically in the camera, avoiding the process of editing later. Timing Is Everything The FinePix Z200fd debuts Fujifilm’s new Couple Timer Mode and Group Timer Mode, ensuring you can appear in every shot you take, even when there’s no one else around to take the picture! Working in conjunction with Face Detection Technology, these self-timer modes automatically capture the image when the camera has detected faces in a frame.'

# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One or several actions, separated by new lines.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
My memory says that I filled the first name and last name, but I can't see any
content in the form. I need to explore different ways to fill the form. Perhaps
the form is not visible yet or some fields are disabled. I need to replan.
</think>

<action>
fill('b534', 'Montre', True)
click('a51')
click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])
</action>
