### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 (use): Yes — it recommends filtering the repo Issues search box by label, which is the fastest way to find help/question issues.
Memory 2 (use): Yes — it says to construct a label-based query in the issues search, which I'll do after we know the label names.
Memory 3 (use): Yes — helpful to first retrieve the repository's label list so we don't miss variations (e.g., "question", "question?", "help wanted", "bug: question", etc.).

Plan: I'll go to the GitHub repository page for kkroening/ffmpeg-python, view the repo labels, then apply a label-based filter in the Issues view to show issues with question/help-related labels. Before I proceed, do you want me to:
- First list all labels in the repo so you can pick which ones to include, or
- Immediately search for common question/help labels like "question", "help wanted", "support", and show matching issues?

Please confirm which you prefer.
