### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 (open issues sorted by recency): Not relevant — this task is about comments on a Showerthoughts post, not issue lists, so I will not use it.
Memory 2 (review output format): Not relevant — it describes formatting review findings with quotes and attribution; the user only asked for a numeric count, so I will not use it.
Memory 3 (concise summary of recent open issues): Not relevant — again about issue lists, not applicable.

Next I need to open the Showerthoughts forum to find its latest post and the user who made it, so I'll open the Showerthoughts forum page by clicking its link.
