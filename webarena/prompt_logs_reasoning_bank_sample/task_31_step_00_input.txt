# Instructions

You are a UI Assistant, your goal is to help the user perform tasks using a web browser. You can
communicate with the user via a chat, in which the user gives you instructions and in which you
can send back messages. You have access to a web browser that both you and the user can see,
and with which only you can interact via specific commands.

Review the instructions from the user, the current state of the page and all other information
to find the best possible next action to accomplish your goal. Your answer will be interpreted
and executed by a program, make sure to follow the formatting instructions.

**Current Progress**: Step 0/10 (10 steps remaining)

**Before choosing your next action:**
- Check your action history below - are you repeating the same actions?
- If yes, try a different approach (search, different menu, filters, etc.)
- Make sure each action brings you closer to completing the goal

## Chat messages:

 - [assistant] Hi! I am your UI assistant, I can perform web tasks for you. What can I help you with?
 - [user] Tell me the count of comments that have received more downvotes than upvotes for the user who made the latest post on the photoshopbattles forum.# Reasoning Memories

Below are some memory items that I accumulated from past interaction from the environment that may be helpful to solve the task. You can use it when you feel it's relevant. In each step, please first explicitly discuss if you want to use each memory item or not, and then take action.

Memory 1:
- Title: Count comments with more downvotes than upvotes by checking net scores
- Description: Determine which comments have received more downvotes than upvotes by inspecting each comment's net score.
- Content: For each comment by the user, check its displayed score (net upvotes minus downvotes) and count those with a negative score; report the total and optionally cite a representative negative score for clarity.
Memory 2:
- Title: Determine downvote-majority by checking a comment's net score
- Description: Identify comments with more downvotes than upvotes by inspecting the comment's displayed net score.
- Content: Many comment UIs show a single net score (upvotes minus downvotes); a negative net score indicates the comment has received more downvotes than upvotes. For counting such comments, iterate through each visible comment and increment a counter whenever its displayed score is negative.
Memory 3:
- Title: Count negative net scores as downvote-majority
- Description: When a comment shows a single numeric score, treat negative values as indicators that downvotes exceed upvotes.
- Content: If the interface displays one number per comment (rather than separate up/down counts), that number is typically the net score (upvotes minus downvotes). Counting comments with negative net scores is the simplest way to identify comments that received more downvotes than upvotes.

# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One or several actions, separated by new lines.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
My memory says that I filled the first name and last name, but I can't see any
content in the form. I need to explore different ways to fill the form. Perhaps
the form is not visible yet or some fields are disabled. I need to replan.
</think>

<action>
fill('b534', 'Montre', True)
click('a51')
click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])
</action>
