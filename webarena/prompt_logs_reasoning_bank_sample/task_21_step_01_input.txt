# Instructions

You are a UI Assistant, your goal is to help the user perform tasks using a web browser. You can
communicate with the user via a chat, in which the user gives you instructions and in which you
can send back messages. You have access to a web browser that both you and the user can see,
and with which only you can interact via specific commands.

Review the instructions from the user, the current state of the page and all other information
to find the best possible next action to accomplish your goal. Your answer will be interpreted
and executed by a program, make sure to follow the formatting instructions.

**Current Progress**: Step 1/10 (9 steps remaining)

**Before choosing your next action:**
- Check your action history below - are you repeating the same actions?
- If yes, try a different approach (search, different menu, filters, etc.)
- Make sure each action brings you closer to completing the goal

## Chat messages:

 - [assistant] Hi! I am your UI assistant, I can perform web tasks for you. What can I help you with?
 - [user] List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about ear cups being small# Reasoning Memories

Below are some memory items that I accumulated from past interaction from the environment that may be helpful to solve the task. You can use it when you feel it's relevant. In each step, please first explicitly discuss if you want to use each memory item or not, and then take action.

Memory 1:
- Title: Confirm the metric and explicitly sort the results before trusting "top" entries
- Description: Always verify which metric defines "best-selling" (units vs revenue) and make sure the table is sorted descending on that metric.
- Content: Check that the report shows the metric column that matches the user's intent (e.g., Order Quantity for units or Sales/Revenue for dollars), then click the column header to enforce a descending sort so the top rows truly represent the top sellers. Note that changing the metric (units vs revenue) can produce different top results, so clarify if needed.
Memory 2:
- Title: Check order-status and return/refund filters
- Description: Make sure the report excludes cancelled, refunded, or draft orders unless those should count toward the best-seller metric.
- Content: Review and set filters for order status and returns so metrics reflect finalized sales only; if the report includes refunds or incomplete orders by default, adjust the filter or aggregate logic to avoid overstating or misranking products.
Memory 3:
- Title: Confirm which metric defines "best‑selling" and explicitly sort by it
- Description: Before trusting top-N results, verify whether "best‑selling" refers to units or revenue and ensure the report is sorted descending on that metric.
- Content: Check the report's visible metric column (e.g., order quantity vs revenue), select the metric that matches the user's intent, and explicitly apply descending sort so the top rows truly represent the highest values for that metric.

Also, because they are so small, they tend to not be very comfortable to use for extended periods.The sound quality is OK, I guess, nothing special here. What they do, they do OK, also they were fairly easy to pair (wouldn't pair with my S10+ the 1st time around, paired well with Tab 6, then paired easily with S10+ the 2nd time)I will be keeping them, but will be looking for a better pair for mowing"

I got about half my ear into it and the rest is on top so for long listening it may hurt the ears. But not horrible. Sound was good! surprisingly so. not audiophile of course but decent. and a big step up from listening on notebook speakers. the built in mic I have yet to try and havent tried noise canceling which there doesn't appear to be a switch for so another negative. I think the better ones are 60 bucks and dont fold . so for some basics for travel these are good. I have a even tinier super light headphone thats bluetooth but not noise canceling for airplanes so my dec for these was def for airlines. I will report back after i fly.Loudness - these get VERY LOUD! Bass - These have excellent BASS Vocals - decent to good not audiophile. Listened to bowie ashes to ashes on amazon music and was quite balanced. Headphone sizing - bands CLICK to positions. very good. Plugging in the USB-B charger mini jack - a huge pain. Has a micro SD slot. I think they would benefit from a audio graphic equalizer to rebalance."

He keeps the volume up loud enough that even with my in-ear headphones on so loud it physically hurt, I could still hear the gym music over my own. So then it was like, my music clashing with "American Pie," which basically meant a headache every single day. So I wanted to get some (inexpensive) noise-canceling headphones to see if I could solve the problem, and these did the trick. I now listen to my own music (and ONLY my own!) at a reasonable volume. The fact that they fold for easier storage in my gym bag is a bonus.'

						StaticText 'Now for being cheap no name brand it works perfectly for the kids during zoom meetings for school. It has blue tooth and headphone jack so when the battery is low they can still use the provided wire to hear the meeting. Now I will say this. The microphone works plugged in to the head jack or Bluetooth but for it picking up the kids voice it has a hard time if they are talking in a low voice. They almost have to speak up for the microphone to hear them talking or it kinda cuts in and out. But for the price and quality and because I’m tired of loaning my kids my Bose and Powerbeats pro headphones for the meetings they work perfectly for what they need. Would definitely buy these again. For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won’t go over mine as I’m an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol. But the kids really like them. I have them in red black. Blue black. And rose gold and white.'

each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One or several actions, separated by new lines.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
My memory says that I filled the first name and last name, but I can't see any
content in the form. I need to explore different ways to fill the form. Perhaps
the form is not visible yet or some fields are disabled. I need to replan.
</think>

<action>
fill('b534', 'Montre', True)
click('a51')
