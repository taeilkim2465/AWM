### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use the memories as follows:
- Memory 1 (Count comments by net score): YES — I'll check each comment's displayed score (net upvotes minus downvotes) and count those with negative scores as downvote-dominant.
- Memory 2 (Use user's comment/activity page and handle pagination): YES — I'll open the author's profile, go to their comments/activity tab, and handle pagination or "load more" to ensure I examine all comments.
- Memory 3 (Confirm the target user before counting): YES — I'll first open the photoshopbattles forum and identify the author of the latest post, to make sure I'm counting the correct user's comments.

Next I'll open the photoshopbattles forum page so I can find the latest post and its author.
