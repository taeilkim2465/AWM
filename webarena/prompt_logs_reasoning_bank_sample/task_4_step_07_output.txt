Memory 1: Use. It tells me to confirm which metric defines "best-selling" and ensure the report is sorted by that metric. The table shows an "Order Quantity" column, so I'll use that as the metric and enforce sorting.

Memory 2: Use. It reiterates to explicitly sort descending on the chosen metric before trusting the top entries — I'll click the "Order Quantity" header to enforce sort.

Memory 3: Use as a caveat. It instructs to check order-status and return/refund filters so totals reflect finalized sales. The current Filter area (Period, From, To, Empty Rows) does not show order-status/refund filters, so I cannot confirm from this page whether cancelled/refunded orders are excluded; I'll note that and ask if you want me to check other report settings.

Now I'll sort the table by Order Quantity (to ensure the top rows are truly the top by units) and report the top-3 products for Jan 2023.
