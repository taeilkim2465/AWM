I will use the memory items as follows:
- Memory 1 (routing services & assumptions): Use it — I'll plan to compute bike time using a routing service after locating the parks and will state assumptions (bike routing, typical conditions).
- Memory 2 (clarify "national park" vs all NPS units): Use it — the term can be ambiguous. I'll assume you mean official "National Park" units (the National Park Service parks with the "National Park" designation) unless you tell me to include all NPS sites; I'll state that assumption and offer the alternative.
- Memory 3 (default origin): Use it — you didn't give a specific address, so I'll assume downtown Vinalhaven as the origin and state that.

First I'll find Vinalhaven, ME on the map so I can look for nearby national parks and measure bike routes. I'll search the map for "Vinalhaven, ME."
