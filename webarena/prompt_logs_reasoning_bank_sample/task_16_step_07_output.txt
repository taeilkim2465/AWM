### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use the saved memories to guide this step:
- Memory 1 (routing services & state assumptions): USE — it reminds me to state assumptions (route type, traffic) when reporting times.
- Memory 2 (directions panel for driving distance & formatted address): USE — the page's directions panel provides the route time/distance and destination formatting I should record.
- Memory 3 (use page's directions/map routing tool): USE — the map page already shows a walking route; I should switch the directions mode to driving on this same tool rather than estimating manually.

Current page shows the walking directions: "Distance: 1.2km. Time: 0:16." To compare walking vs driving, I'll switch the routing mode to "Car (OSRM)" and run the directions to get the driving time/distance from the same directions panel. Then I'll report both times and note assumptions (OSRM, fastest route, typical/no traffic as appropriate).
