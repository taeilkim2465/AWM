I will use Memory 1 and Memory 2 to guide the search and reporting: Memory 1 says to include exact quoted text, reviewer name, and date (and note whether all review pages were searched). Memory 2 says to search each paginated review page. I will not apply Memory 3 yet (it's for tie-breaking or exporting) but I can offer follow-ups after gathering matches.

Currently I'm on the Reviews page showing page 1. I can already see two reviewers on this page who mention fingerprint resistance: "Rachel" (verbatim: "It is super clear and fingerprint resistant.") and "T. Gannon" (verbatim: "it does seem to resist fingerprints and stay cleaner."). To be comprehensive I should check page 2 as well, so I'll click the "Page 2" link to search the next page of reviews.
