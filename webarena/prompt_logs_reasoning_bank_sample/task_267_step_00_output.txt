Memory 1: I will use this. I should ask whether the user means the official "National Park" designation or any National Park Service site (and if they don't answer I'll default to official national parks and state that assumption).

Memory 2: I will use this. If the user doesn't provide a specific origin address I should use the city's downtown as the start point and state that assumption, and report driving distance and estimated driving time with units.

Memory 3: I will not use this (it's about searching paginated reviews, not relevant).

I need to clarify two ambiguities before searching: which place counts as Stephen King's "hometown" (birthplace Portland, grew up in Durham, or longtime residence Bangor) and whether they mean only official National Parks or any National Park Service unit. If the user doesn't answer I should default to Bangor (most commonly associated with him) and to official National Parks. I'll ask those clarifying questions now.

If you don’t specify I will default to official National Parks. Also, do you prefer distance in miles or kilometers?')
