Memory 1 (open issues) is not relevant to this task, so I will not use it.
Memory 2 (review output format) is not relevant; the user only requested a count, so I will not use it.
Memory 3 (concise summary of open issues) is not relevant, so I will not use it.

I need to view the comments made by the user who posted the latest Showerthoughts submission (nirinaron). The page shows profile navigation with "Overview / Submissions / Comments" — I'll click the "Comments" tab to list their comments so I can count which have more downvotes than upvotes.
