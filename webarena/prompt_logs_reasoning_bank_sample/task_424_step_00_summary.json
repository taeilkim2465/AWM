Fred Rogers' show is commonly associated with Pittsburgh and WQED; I'll search for the WQED studio in Pittsburgh as the filming location.\n- Memory 3 (search reviews) — Not relevant.\n\nNext action: search the OpenStreetMap search box for \"WQED Pittsburgh\" to find the map page for the studio where Mr. Rogers was filmed, then open the result.",
