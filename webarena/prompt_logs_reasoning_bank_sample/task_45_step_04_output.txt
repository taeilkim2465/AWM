Memory 1: I will not use this right now — it’s about reporting reviewer snippets for reviews, which isn’t relevant to simply viewing the most recent open issues.
Memory 2: I will use this — after opening an issue I should offer clear follow-up options (open next issue, view full thread, export, etc.).
Memory 3: I will not use this right now — it’s about exhaustive scanning of product-page reviews (not needed to open the latest issue).

Plan: Open the top (most recent) open issue in the list so I can read its details and then present follow-up options.
