Memory 1: Use it. I will verify that "best-selling" is measured by Order Quantity (the table currently shows an "Order Quantity" column). I will also ensure the report is sorted/aggregated by that metric. To get a proper top seller for the quarter, I should aggregate across the three months.

Memory 2: Use it but adapt — the UI doesn't offer "Quarter" as a Period option (only Day/Month/Year). To aggregate for Q1 2022 I can keep the From/To as 1/1/22–3/31/22 and change Period to "Year" so the report aggregates the range into a single interval (one rowgroup) and gives totals per product across the quarter. That will give the top product by Order Quantity for the quarter without manual summing.

Memory 3: Partially use. I should ensure cancelled/refunded orders are excluded, but I don't see order-status filters on this page. If such filters exist elsewhere, we'd need to adjust them; for now I'll proceed with the visible filters and aggregated period and then inspect results to confirm the metric.

Next action: change Period to "Year" (so the report aggregates the specified From/To range) and click "Show Report" to refresh the table with aggregated totals for Q1.
