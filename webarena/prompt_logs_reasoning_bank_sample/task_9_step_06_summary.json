I'll run the directions (click \"Go\") to get the driving distance and time and capture the full address string shown by the mapping interface. After I get that result, I'll test other nearby candidate airports one-by-one in subsequent steps (e.g., Oxnard Airport, Camarillo, Santa Barbara, Burbank, Long Beach, etc.) to see which are within 30 km driving distance.",
