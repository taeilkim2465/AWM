### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I'll use the page's directions widget to get both walking and driving times, and I'll explicitly state routing assumptions.

- Memory 1 (Use routing services and state route assumptions): I will use this. I'll report that the times come from OSRM (the page's routing engine), that OSRM uses routing profiles (fastest route for the selected mode) and does not include live traffic — it's an estimated time based on typical routing speeds. I'll note units and that you can ask for alternatives (no-traffic vs live traffic) if desired.

- Memory 2 (Use the directions panel to get driving distance and the formatted address): I will use this. The directions panel already shows the walking result (Distance: 1.2km. Time: 0:16). I'll switch the mode to Car (OSRM) and read the driving distance/time from the directions panel.

- Memory 3 (Use the page's directions/map routing tool for driving-distance requests): I will use this. I'll obtain driving route/time from the displayed directions (not compute straight-line distance).

Next action: switch the routing mode to Car (OSRM) and run directions to get the driving time.
