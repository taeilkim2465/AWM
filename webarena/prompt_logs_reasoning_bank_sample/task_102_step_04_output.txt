### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: Use the repository's Issues search box with a label-based filter — I will use this (relevant and fastest).
Memory 2: Apply a label-based search query in the issues search box — I will use this (we already have the query entered).
Memory 3: Broaden or combine label filters if results are sparse — I will keep this in mind if the filtered results are too few.

The search input (id 659) currently contains: label:"help wanted" OR label:"good first issue" but the results still show many unfiltered items. I will submit the search to ensure the label filter is applied.
