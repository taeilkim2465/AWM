<think>
Memory 1: Not useful — it discusses tie-breaking and exports for reports (orders), unrelated to scanning product reviews. I will not use it.
Memory 2: Not useful — it's about order-status and refund filters. I will not use it.
Memory 3: Not useful — it's about defining "best‑selling" metrics. I will not use it.

Current page shows the first page of 12 customer reviews. To find reviewers who mention "under water", "underwater", or taking photos under water I should check the remaining reviews on page 2 as well. I'll open page 2 of the reviews to scan the rest.
