I'm just opening the Issues list to find the most recent open issues, so I won't use this memory now.\n\nMemory 2: \"Offer clear follow-up options...\" — Partially relevant. After I show the list of recent open issues, I'll offer follow-up options (open an issue, filter by label, view full details). I won't apply it before navigating, but I'll use it after we see the issues.\n\nMemory 3: \"Exhaustive product-page review scan\" — Not relevant here (it's about scanning product reviews). I'll not use it.\n\nPlan: navigate to the repository's Issues list (left sidebar “Issues”) to view the most recent open issues. I'll click the Issues link in the project navigation.",
