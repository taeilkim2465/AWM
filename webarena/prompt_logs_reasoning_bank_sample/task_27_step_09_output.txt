I will use Memory 2 (Review output format) because when I report the count I should present exact snippets and a concise summary. I will not use Memory 1 or Memory 3 since they are about open issues lists and formatting of issue lists which aren't relevant to counting comment vote balances.

The page currently shows the user's Overview. To see all their comments and the displayed scores (so I can count comments with more downvotes than upvotes, i.e., negative scores), I need to open the "Comments" tab. I'll click the Comments tab to load the full comments list so I can count negative-scored comments.
