### LLM RESPONSE ###

I will use the stored memories because they match the task:
- Memory 1: Use it — it instructs to use the mapping/directions tool to determine driving distances and capture the full address string for each result; that's exactly what the user requested.
- Memory 2: Use it — it asks to report map address, route distance/time, and whether it meets the threshold, which I will do in the final step.
- Memory 3: Use it — it recommends filling the origin/destination in the directions widget to get driving distances/times; I will use the page's directions panel.

Planned actions: query the directions widget for Buffalo Niagara International Airport first (to get the route distance/time and the full address as shown), then query Niagara Falls International Airport the same way. I'll click Go after filling the 'To' field and wait briefly for the directions to appear so I can read the Distance/Time and the address text.
