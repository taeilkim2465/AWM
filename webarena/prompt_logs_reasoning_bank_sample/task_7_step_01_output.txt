### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory items:
- Memory 1 (default origin): NOT using — the user specified Carnegie Mellon University so we will use that as the origin.
- Memory 2 (straight-line cross-check): NOT using yet — the user asked for driving distance (50 km); if needed later I can compute straight-line distances as a cross-check.
- Memory 3 (use page's directions tool): USING — I'll open the map's directions widget to get driving distances from Carnegie Mellon University to candidate airports.

Next action: open the "Find directions between two points" tool on the OpenStreetMap page so I can enter Carnegie Mellon University as origin and then test airports (Pittsburgh International Airport and any other nearby international airports) to check driving distances.
