Memory check:
- Memory 1 (Review output format): I will use this — it tells me to include exact review snippets, reviewer name, posting date, and a concise summary when reporting findings.
- Memory 2 (Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups): I will use this — it instructs me to provide verbatim snippets, attribution, date, and to note whether pagination was fully searched and offer to open full reviews or continue searching.
- Memory 3 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): I will use this — it says to search reviews by keyword and iterate through all review pages, recording which page each match came from.

Current plan:
- The page shows reviews and indicates I'm on page 2. I need to check other review pages for mentions of "average print quality" (or similar wording). I'll go to Page 1 to inspect the other reviews (to exhaust pagination per Memory 3).

Action to take:
- Click the "Page 1" link (element id 2507) to load the first page of reviews.
