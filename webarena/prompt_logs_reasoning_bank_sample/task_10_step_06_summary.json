I will use the directions panel on the page to obtain those values for each candidate airport.\n- Memory 2 (Use): Yes — it tells me to report the map-address, route distance/time, and whether it meets the threshold; I'll gather the address and route distance/time after the route is generated and later present whether it's within 60 km.\n- Memory 3 (Use): Yes — it specifically recommends filling the origin and destination fields in the directions widget and reading the resulting route distance and drive-time. I will do that now.\n\nPlan: Replace the current destination with \"Buffalo Niagara International Airport\", run directions from \"City of Niagara Falls, NY, USA\" and wait for the routing results so I can read the full address and driving distance/time shown by the interface.",
