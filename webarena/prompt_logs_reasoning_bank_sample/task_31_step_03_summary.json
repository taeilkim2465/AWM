They will be applied later when I inspect the user's comments.\n\n- Use Memory 1? Yes — it outlines checking each comment's net score and counting negatives.\n- Use Memory 2? Yes — it reiterates that a negative net score indicates more downvotes.\n- Use Memory 3? Yes — same guidance; I'll follow this when counting.\n\nNext I need to find the photoshopbattles forum in the forum list. To make that easier I'll switch the forum list to alphabetical order so I can locate \"photoshopbattles\" (which should appear under P). I'll click the \"Alphabetical\" navigation link to reorder the list.",
