I will use the memories as follows:
- Memory 1 (default origin and how to report driving distance): Use — the directions widget already shows Carnegie Mellon University as the origin; I'll state that origin clearly when reporting distances.
- Memory 2 (cross-check with straight-line distance): Do not use right now — the user asked about driving distance, so road distance from the directions tool is the primary measure.
- Memory 3 (use the page's directions/map tool to get travel distance and time): Use — the OpenStreetMap directions widget is already filled with Carnegie Mellon University (origin) and Pittsburgh International Airport (destination), so I'll use it to obtain the driving distance and time.

Next I will run the directions query (click "Go") so the page will calculate the driving distance and time from Carnegie Mellon University to Pittsburgh International Airport; that will let me confirm whether it is within 50 km and capture the airport's full address shown in the form.
