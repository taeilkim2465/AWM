The report must be measured by units (Order Quantity) and I should ensure the table is sorted descending on that column before trusting the top entries.\n\nMemory 2 (Check order-status and returns): I will use this. Best-seller ranking should exclude cancelled/refunded/draft orders; I'll verify filters if needed (if the UI exposes order-status filters). The current visible filter area doesn't show order-status, so I'll first ensure the sort/metric is correct, then if needed I'll look for status/return filters.\n\nMemory 3 (Prefer built-in aggregation & period): I will use this. The Period is already set to Year and From/To are 1/1/22–12/31/22, which matches the 2022 aggregation. I'll confirm the report is using that period and the built-in aggregation.\n\nNext action: ensure the table is explicitly sorted by Order Quantity (click the Order Quantity column header).",
