### LLM RESPONSE ###

I will use the memory items as follows before taking the next action:

- Memory 1 (Confirm metric & sort): Use. The user asked for "best-selling" which could mean units or revenue. The report has an "Order Quantity" column (units). I should confirm we're using units (Order Quantity) and that the report is sorted/aggregated by that metric. Because the table shows individual order lines (many rows have Order Quantity = 1), sorting alone won't give aggregated product totals unless the report groups by product.

- Memory 2 (Prefer built-in aggregation/period granularity): Partially use. The report's Period control offers Day/Month/Year (no explicit "Quarter"), but the date range is already set to 1/1/22–3/31/22 which corresponds to Q1. The report doesn't appear to provide a direct "group by product with aggregated totals for the selected period" in the current view, so I will attempt to export the data (CSV) so I can get full rows and aggregate counts to determine the top product for Q1.

- Memory 3 (Check order-status/returns filters): Consider but cannot fully apply. I don't see order-status or return/refund filters in this Bestsellers Report UI. That means the report may already include only finalized orders, but I cannot change that here. I'll note this as a caveat in the result.

Next action: export the report to CSV (the "Export to: CSV" option is already selected) so we can get the full dataset and accurately compute aggregated order quantities per product for Q1 2022.
