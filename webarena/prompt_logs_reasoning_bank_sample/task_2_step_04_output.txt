### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: Use — I will confirm that "best-selling" is measured by Order Quantity and ensure the table is sorted by that column descending before trusting the top row.
Memory 2: Use with adjustment — the report doesn't offer a "Quarter" option (only Day, Month, Year), but the date range is already set to 1/1/22–3/31/22 (Q1). I'll rely on the date range rather than changing the Period control.
Memory 3: Use — I should verify there are no filters excluding finalized orders (I don't see order-status filters on this page), so I'll proceed but remain aware this report may include all orders shown.

Next action: sort the table by the "Order Quantity" column to make sure the top row reflects the highest quantity.
