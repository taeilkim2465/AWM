### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use the stored memories because they directly describe how to identify and count comments with more downvotes than upvotes and how to navigate a user's comment/activity page:

- Memory 1: Use. It describes checking each comment's displayed net score and counting negatives — relevant to deciding which comments have more downvotes.
- Memory 2: Use. It clarifies that a single numeric score is typically net (upvotes minus downvotes) and negative values indicate downvote-majority — simplifies counting.
- Memory 3: Use. It reminds to open the author's profile, go to their comments/activity, and handle pagination or "load more" to ensure we count all comments.

Next I need to find the DIY forum in the forums list. It's not visible in the current viewport, so I'll scroll down the list to locate and open the DIY forum.
