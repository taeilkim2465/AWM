I will use the provided memories because they describe exactly how to show recent open issues (open filter + sort by newest, show total count, and provide a concise summary). 
- Memory 1: use — instructs to filter to "Open" and sort by creation date descending and report top items.
- Memory 2: use — reminds to note the total open issue count.
- Memory 3: use — use a compact format for the top items.

Next I need to open the project's Issues list so I can apply the "Open" filter and sort by newest. I'll click the "Issues" link in the project sidebar.
