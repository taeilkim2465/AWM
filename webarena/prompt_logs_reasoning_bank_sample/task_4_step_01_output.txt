### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 and Memory 2 (confirming which metric defines "best-selling" and ensuring the report is sorted descending on that metric) are relevant — I will use them to verify whether the report shows units sold or revenue and to enforce the correct sort before trusting the top-3. Memory 3 (check order-status and return/refund filters) is also relevant — I will use it to ensure cancelled/refunded/draft orders are excluded so the ranking reflects finalized sales.

Next action: open the Reports -> Products -> Bestsellers report so I can set the date range to January 2023 and then check/apply the appropriate metric, sort order, and status filters.
