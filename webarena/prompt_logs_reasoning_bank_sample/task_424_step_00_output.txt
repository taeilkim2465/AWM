### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory check:
- Memory 1 (use directions/map tool) — Not needed for this step; the user asked to find the map page for the place where Mr. Rogers was filmed, not to get distances.
- Memory 2 (resolve place-identity ambiguities using common associations) — I will use this. Fred Rogers' show is commonly associated with Pittsburgh and WQED; I'll search for the WQED studio in Pittsburgh as the filming location.
- Memory 3 (search reviews) — Not relevant.

Next action: search the OpenStreetMap search box for "WQED Pittsburgh" to find the map page for the studio where Mr. Rogers was filmed, then open the result.
