I will not use Memory 1 (open issues) — it's irrelevant to this forum/profile task.
I will not use Memory 2 (review output format) — it's about presenting review snippets, not needed here.
I will not use Memory 3 (concise summary of recent open issues) — also irrelevant.

Plan: open the profile page for the author of the top (latest) post on the Showerthoughts page (the "Waoonet" link at node 155) so I can view that user's comments and find which comments have more downvotes than upvotes.
