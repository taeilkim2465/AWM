Memory check and use:
- Memory 1 (Use): Yes — it instructs to use the mapping/directions tool to get driving distances and the full address string from the map results. I will use the directions panel on the page to obtain those values for each candidate airport.
- Memory 2 (Use): Yes — it tells me to report the map-address, route distance/time, and whether it meets the threshold; I'll gather the address and route distance/time after the route is generated and later present whether it's within 60 km.
- Memory 3 (Use): Yes — it specifically recommends filling the origin and destination fields in the directions widget and reading the resulting route distance and drive-time. I will do that now.

Plan: Replace the current destination with "Buffalo Niagara International Airport", run directions from "City of Niagara Falls, NY, USA" and wait for the routing results so I can read the full address and driving distance/time shown by the interface.
