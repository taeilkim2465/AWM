The page shows a single numeric score per comment (net score), so negative numbers indicate more downvotes than upvotes.\nMemory 3: Use it. It suggests using the user's comments/activity page and handling pagination — I should open the author's profile \"Comments\" tab to see all their comments and look for pagination or \"load more\".\n\nNext step: open the user's \"Comments\" tab on their profile to list all comments and check the displayed scores. I'll click the \"Comments\" tab.",
