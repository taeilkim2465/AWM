Memory items about searching reviews and pagination are not relevant to this task (they concern paginated reviews). I will not use any memory items.

I need to find the closest national park to Portland, Maine. To do that I should locate Portland on the map so I can check nearby national parks. The page currently shows a search for Acadia National Park, so I'll search for "Portland, Maine" instead.
