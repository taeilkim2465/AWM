  "think": "Memory 1 (Confirm metric and sort): I will use this. The table clearly has an \"Order Quantity\" column, which is the metric for \"best-selling\" here. The UI doesn't show an explicit sort indicator, but the values are visible and the top two products both have 3 — so I'll rely on the shown Order Quantity values and note the tie.\n\nMemory 2 (Prefer built-in aggregation / quarter period): I will not change the Period control now. The date range is already From 1/1/22 to 3/31/22 (Q1 2022), and the table shows aggregated totals for that range. If you want, we could change the Period to \"Quarter\" and refresh to confirm aggregation, but it's not necessary to answer this question.\n\nMemory 3 (Check order-status and returns filters): I will not modify these filters now. The report likely uses finalized orders by default; if you need strict confirmation (exclude refunds/cancelled), we can adjust filters and rerun the report.\n\nConclusion from the visible report: the top-selling product(s) by Order Quantity for Q1 2022 are tied.",
