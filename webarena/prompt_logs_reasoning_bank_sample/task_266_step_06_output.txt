Current page: OpenStreetMap directions are already loaded from "Portland, Cumberland County, Maine" to "Acadia National Park, Bar Harbor, Hancock County, Maine." The directions panel shows Distance: 284 km and Time: 3:44 (i.e., about 176 miles and ~3 h 44 min by car). There is only one national park in Maine (Acadia), so this is the nearest national park to Portland.
