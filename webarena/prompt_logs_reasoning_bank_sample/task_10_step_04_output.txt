### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use the mapping/directions tool on this OpenStreetMap page to get driving distances and the full address strings for candidate airports — this matches the user's request and the stored memories.

- Memory 1 (Use the directions panel for proximity checks and report full details): I will use this. It instructs to capture driving distance/time and the full address shown by the mapping interface, which is exactly what we need.
- Memory 2 (Report map-address, route distance/time, and whether it meets the threshold; offer sensible follow-ups): I will use this after obtaining results to present the address, distance/time, and whether each airport is within 60 km, and to suggest next steps.
- Memory 3 (Use the page's directions/map tool to get travel distance and time): I will use this as the operational method to measure driving distance.

Next action: request a driving route from Niagara Falls (already set as origin) to Buffalo Niagara International Airport to read the route distance/time and the address string that the map displays.
