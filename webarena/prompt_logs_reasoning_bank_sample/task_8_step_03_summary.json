Driving distance (per the directions panel): 33 km, estimated driving time: 0:32.\\n\\nIf you want, I can: (1) search for any smaller/regional airports within 5 km (they may not be designated \\\"international\\\"), (2) compute straight-line distances to nearby airports for comparison, or (3) expand the driving-radius to a different threshold (for example 10 or 20 km). Which would you like?')",

If you want geographic (straight-line) distances as well I can compute those.\n\nI’ll report results based on the map directions shown (origin = Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15213, United States).",
