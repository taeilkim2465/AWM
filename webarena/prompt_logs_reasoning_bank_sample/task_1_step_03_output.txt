### LLM RESPONSE ###

I inspected the Bestsellers Report table for the period 1/1/22–3/31/22 (Q1 2022) and summed order quantities by brand from the product names shown. Sprite has the highest total: 1 (Sprite Stasis Ball in Jan) + 2 (Sprite Yoga Strap 6ft in Feb) + 2 (Sprite Yoga Strap 8ft in Feb) = 5 orders, which is more than any other brand.
