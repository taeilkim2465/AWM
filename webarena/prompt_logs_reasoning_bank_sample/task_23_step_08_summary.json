It says to search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination. I'll follow that approach and check the other reviews page(s).\n\nMemory 3: Not needed right now. Tie-breaking/export options are unnecessary for a simple keyword search, but I can offer refinements after collecting matches.\n\nPlan: The current page is Reviews page 2. I'll navigate to Page 1 of reviews to scan the remaining reviews for mentions of \"fingerprint\", \"fingerprints\", \"fingerprint resistant\", \"anti-fingerprint\", or similar phrases.",
