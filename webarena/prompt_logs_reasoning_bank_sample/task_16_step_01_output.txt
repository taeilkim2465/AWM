### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I'll use the page's directions UI to get route times, so Memories 1–3 are relevant.

- Memory 1 (routing services & assumptions): Use. It reminds me to state assumptions about route type and traffic when reporting times.
- Memory 2 (directions panel for driving distance & formatted address): Use. The directions UI on this page is the correct place to read the driving route time and formatted addresses.
- Memory 3 (use page's routing tool for driving requests): Use. Prefer the site’s route engine rather than straight-line distances.

Plan: fill the "From" and "To" boxes with the addresses (origin: "5000 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh"; destination: "UPMC Family Health Center, Pittsburgh"), then click Go to get the driving (Car) route. I will run the driving query first; afterwards I'll switch to walking (Foot) and query to compare times (in a later step).
