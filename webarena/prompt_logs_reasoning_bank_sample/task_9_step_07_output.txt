### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I'll use the mapping/directions memories to get driving distances and addresses from the site.

- Memory 1 (Use the directions panel for proximity checks and report full details): USE — it tells me to capture driving distance/time and the full address string from the mapping interface for each candidate airport; that's exactly what the user asked for.
- Memory 2 (Use the page's directions/map tool to get travel distance and time): USE — it instructs to fill origin/destination and read route distance/time from the site's directions widget, which is the most reliable way to measure driving distance.
- Memory 3 (Default origin is downtown if none given): DO NOT USE — the origin (Carnegie Art Museum 800 Hobson Way Oxnard CA 93030) is already provided on the page, so I don't need to assume a default.

Next I'll run the directions query currently configured (origin = Carnegie Art Museum, destination = Los Angeles International Airport) to get the driving distance/time and the full address string shown by the map/directions panel. This will let me check whether LAX is within 30 km; if it's farther than 30 km I'll then test other nearby airports as needed.
