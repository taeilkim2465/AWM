### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 (Confirm metric & sort): USE. The report shows an "Order Quantity" column, but I should ensure the table is explicitly sorted descending by that metric so the top rows reflect best-selling by units. I'll click the "Order Quantity" column header to enforce descending sort if needed.

Memory 2 (Check order-status and returns filters): USE (but limited). I should verify the report excludes cancelled/refunded/draft orders. I don't see order-status or returns filters in the current filter panel (only Period, From/To, Empty Rows), so I can't change that from here. I'll note this limitation after ensuring the sort.

Memory 3 (Prefer built-in aggregation/period grouping): USE. The report is already using Period = Year and the From/To are set to 1/1/22–12/31/22, which is appropriate. Using the built-in report (rather than manual summation) is best — I'll rely on the displayed aggregated table once sorted.

Planned action: click the "Order Quantity" column header to ensure sorting by units sold.
