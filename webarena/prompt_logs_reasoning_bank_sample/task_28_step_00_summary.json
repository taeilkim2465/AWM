It directly describes how to identify comments with more downvotes than upvotes by looking for negative displayed scores.\nMemory 2 (use profile/comments page and handle pagination) — USE. I will need to open the author's profile and look through their comments, accounting for pagination or \"load more\".\nMemory 3 (open latest post author's profile) — USE. It tells me to navigate from the latest post to the author's profile, which is exactly how to find their comment history.\n\nNext step: open the Forums page so I can find and open the Worcester forum and then locate its latest post. I'll click the \"Forums\" link in the top navigation.",
