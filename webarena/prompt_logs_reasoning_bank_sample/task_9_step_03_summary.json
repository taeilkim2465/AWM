It matches the user's request to report full addresses and driving distances/times from the mapping directions panel.\n- Memory 2 (Use the page's directions/map tool to get travel distance and time): I will use this as well — I'll compute road driving distance/time using the site's directions widget.\n- Memory 3 (Default origin = downtown if none given): I will NOT use this memory because the user provided a specific place (Carnegie Art Museum, 800 Hobson Way, Oxnard, CA 93030), so I should use that as the origin.\n\nPlan: I'll enter the Carnegie Art Museum address into the \"From\" field, then use the directions widget to check likely nearby candidate international airports one-by-one (starting with Los Angeles International Airport). I'll run the route to see the driving distance/time and read the full address shown in the directions result. First action: set the origin to the museum and destination to \"Los Angeles International Airport\" and run directions.",
