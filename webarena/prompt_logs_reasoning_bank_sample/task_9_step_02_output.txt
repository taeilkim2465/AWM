<think>
Memory 1: Use the directions panel for proximity checks and report full details — I will use this. It matches the user's request to report driving distances and the full address strings shown by the mapping interface.
Memory 2: Use the page's directions/map tool to get travel distance and time — I will use this too; it tells me to fill the origin/destination in the site's directions widget to get route distance and time.
Memory 3: Default origin and how to report driving distance — I will NOT use the default-downtown assumption because the user gave an exact address (Carnegie Art Museum 800 Hobson Way Oxnard CA 93030), so I'll use that as the origin.

Next, I'll open the site's directions widget so I can enter the Carnegie Art Museum as origin and test candidate international airports (starting with nearby well-known international airports like LAX, SBA, BUR) to get driving distances and addresses.
