### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory check and use:
- Memory 1 (routing services and state route assumptions): I will use this. I should state assumptions about route type and traffic when I report times.
- Memory 2 (use directions panel to get driving distance/time and formatted address): I will use this to read the driving result already shown in the Directions panel.
- Memory 3 (use page's directions/map routing tool for driving-distance requests): I will use this to compute the walking route on the same page so both modes come from the same routing engine.

What I see now: the Directions panel currently shows a driving route (Car (OSRM)) with Distance: 1.2 km and Time: 0:02 (2 minutes). To compare walking vs driving, I need the walking route time. I'll switch the mode to Foot (OSRM) and run the directions to get the walking time from the same routing service, then report both with assumptions (OSRM, typical/no traffic = routing engine estimate).
