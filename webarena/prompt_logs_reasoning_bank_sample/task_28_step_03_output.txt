Memory 1: Use it — I'll check each comment's displayed score (net upvotes minus downvotes) to identify negative scores as comments with more downvotes than upvotes.
Memory 2: Use it — I'll open the author's profile and go to their comments/activity; I may need to handle pagination or "load more" if their history spans multiple pages.
Memory 3: Use it — I'll navigate from the latest post to the author's profile to access their comment history.

Next, I'll open the latest post author's profile by clicking their username ("graemeknows") in the topmost post so I can view their comments.
