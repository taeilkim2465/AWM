The page already shows the \"Open\" tab with \"21\" and \"Created date\" + sort direction \"Descending\", so I should report the total count and confirm the sort order.\n- Memory 2 (Concise summary of recent open issues): USE. I'll present a compact, readable list of the top items.\n- Memory 3 (Summarize the top N issues with numbers and short titles): USE. I'll list the top 10 most recent open issues (issue number + short title, labels or one-line context) so you can pick one to inspect.\n\nThe page is already on \"Open (21)\" and sorted by Created date, descending, so the top items are the most recent open issues.",
