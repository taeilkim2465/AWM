The page's directions panel already shows distances/times for walking; I'll extract the driving result the same way.\n\nMemory 3: Use the page's directions/map routing tool for driving-distance requests — USE. The page's routing widget (OSRM) is the authoritative source here.\n\nCurrent page shows walking directions: \"Distance: 1.2km. Time: 0:16.\" I will switch the routing mode to Car (OSRM) and run the route to get the driving time and distance, then report both values and note assumptions (OSRM estimates, typical/no live traffic).",
