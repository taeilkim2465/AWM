# Instructions

You are a UI Assistant, your goal is to help the user perform tasks using a web browser. You can
communicate with the user via a chat, in which the user gives you instructions and in which you
can send back messages. You have access to a web browser that both you and the user can see,
and with which only you can interact via specific commands.

Review the instructions from the user, the current state of the page and all other information
to find the best possible next action to accomplish your goal. Your answer will be interpreted
and executed by a program, make sure to follow the formatting instructions.

**Current Progress**: Step 1/10 (9 steps remaining)

**Before choosing your next action:**
- Check your action history below - are you repeating the same actions?
- If yes, try a different approach (search, different menu, filters, etc.)
- Make sure each action brings you closer to completing the goal

## Chat messages:

 - [assistant] Hi! I am your UI assistant, I can perform web tasks for you. What can I help you with?
 - [user] List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about average print quality# Reasoning Memories

Below are some memory items that I accumulated from past interaction from the environment that may be helpful to solve the task. You can use it when you feel it's relevant. In each step, please first explicitly discuss if you want to use each memory item or not, and then take action.

Memory 1:
- Title: Review output format
- Description: When reporting review findings, present exact review snippets plus clear attribution and a concise summary.
- Content: Include the exact quote(s) from reviews, the reviewer name, the posting date, and the review title (if available). Finish with a one-sentence summary stating whether the requested sentiment or claim (e.g., "price unfair") was found.
Memory 2:
- Title: Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups
- Description: When listing reviewers who mention a specific issue, provide verbatim snippets, attribution, and options to fetch more context.
- Content: Include the exact quoted text, reviewer name, and date (or page number) for each match and note whether the search covered all review pages; offer to open full reviews or continue searching further pages for more matches.
Memory 3:
- Title: Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination
- Description: When looking for reviewers who mention a specific detail, use in-page search and iterate through all paginated review pages.
- Content: Use the browser's find feature or a site search for the target keyword(s), and loop through each reviews page until no new matches appear; record which page each match came from so the search is comprehensive and reproducible.

						StaticText "I've had this printer about a year. It gives great print quality as long as you use the premium paper settings (doesn't actually have to be the premium paper) and set it to high quality. Printing standard quality on plain paper is really only good enough for printing documents, online tickets, things like that.I make & sell stickers, greeting cards, etc, and I've used this printer for that since my WF 7620 had a printhead go bad - which cost nearly as much to replace as the printer itself. The 3620 has done well, but like all printers, they now have designed obsolescence so they all have issues eventually. Recently it started being unable to align the printheads even after running numerous alignments and the colors are no longer coming out correctly. I started having those color issues about 8 months in but I was able to work around it for a while by adjusting the color settings, now no amount of adjustments corrects it. Tons of head cleans haven't fixed the issue so I'm replacing it with an EcoTank model - because this printer goes through ink cartridges like crazy. I do print a lot, probably 20 or more pages a week on average, and I buy cartridges about every month or two which gets really expensive and ends up being several hundred dollars a year in cartridges.Horrible ink cost (but kind of typical)I had no issues setting up the wifi - works great.The scan feature works great, I love that it can scan straight to PDF for documents.I've never used any devices other than my PC to print from it so I can't comment on print anywhere featuresI have no issues with the menu or buttonsI have had paper jam issues, where the paper doesn't actually jam, it just doesn't want to pull a sheet out of the tray. Usually if I open/close the tray and tell it to try again it resolves the issue.I had issues with my WF 7620 denting the end of the paper when pulling it from the tray and causing jams - this printer did not have that issue.This printer has never sat unused for more than a couple of days, so I have never had any issues with ink drying out.Print speed for plain documents is really fast, print speed for high quality photo type prints is much slower but I found it to be as expected for any printer laying down that much ink and detail.This printer is a good size, not hard to move around and not terribly heavy. One person can do it. The WF 7620 I had previously has a large scanner bed so that printer is a nightmare to move compared to this printer - it can be moved by one person but I don't recommend it if you like your back the way it is.I have printed on 110 lb card stock from the paper tray with little to no feed issues (other than the one feed issue that happens with any paper I put in)I have printed glossy sticker paper with the only issue being the leading edge of the image sometimes smudges but only if there's a lot of dark ink at the top of the page.Plain paper printed with no issuesGlossy holographic card stock printed with no issues.The only paper I have had consistently jam in this printer is Silhouette's sticker paper - no idea why, as it isn't any thicker than my glossy sticker paper from LDAll in all, for what I originally paid for it, it has done its job and served me well. I've worked it hard, and it held up to a lot of abuse.Attached pictures are items that were printed on this printer, greeting card, stickers, bookmarker (laminated after printing on matte cardstock)"

						StaticText "I tried using an Epson printer years ago. My first computer printer was an Epson, in fact. I didn't have much luck with it then, but tried Epson again after learning that they are cheap to operate due to the cheap cost of their inkjet cartridges. Unfortunately, it seems that Epson printers clog up and cannot be unclogged using the printer's normal functions. Some claim you can remove part of the printing mechanism and clean it manually by soaking it, but honestly, I don't care to take the chance on damaging the machine. This might be a good choice for someone who prints every day, especially since it can be operated more cheaply than most printers, but it isn't for me. I have finally given up on the Epson and have purchased another all-in-one system. The scanner, at least, works well and is fast."

						StaticText "When it worked this printer was an OK printer. The print quality was average. Using the tools to improve the print quality (cleaning / alignment) were more of a waste of ink. It slightly improved for maybe 10 copies. Overall the printer was an ink hog. It would warn you that you were running low on ink, if you replaced the cartridge, when it cycled it would seemingly check all the ink colors thus resulting in other colors running low. I say this because it would show the black as low and the others as fine then I'd replace the black and suddenly magenta was low.Epson does not have driver updates for this. I get regular notices that my driver is out of date but the reality is that they don't support it any longer. This actually happened less than a year after buying it. Now when I try to use the printer or the scanner it prints the first inch and gives an error code. The suggested work around is to cancel all print jobs, turn off the printer and then try again. When I do that it may work for the first couple of pages of a document or a few copies of a document but will not do more than 5 pages at a time. I plan to continue to use it this way until the ink I have is gone. At that time I will be going to a second story balcony to drop it on to concrete.... unless I decide that is too cruel to the concrete."

						StaticText "There's a reason ONE THIRD OF THE REVIEWS ON THIS PRINTER ARE ONE STAR. THERE'S A REASON....ACTUALLY, SEVERAL REASONS. Overall, it's a poorly designed piece of junk that does not perform reliably. It's consistent, but unfortunately consistently lousy .Changing ink cartridges successfully has been a constant challenge. It won't recognize replacement ink cartridges..Epson or clone...about half the time. When working in a home office without other printers to turn to, that alone is reason to take a sledge hammer to this piece of junk.The default setting is for two sided printing. I couldn't find how to change the default. Called customer service, and through very broken English was told there was no way to change their arbitrary 2-sided default other than to manually uncheck 2-sided printing in the printer dialogue box MANUALLY FOR EVERY SINGLE DOCUMENT YOU WANT TO PRINT. I found it hard to believe such a moronic process was the only option, so the following week I called back again with the same questions....how to set the default to one sided printing and was told the same answer I got on the prior call....in even harder to understand attempts at English language.I should have sent this loser back the first time it wouldn't recognize an Epson cartridge, which was the very first time a cartridge needed replacement....and almost every cartridge change since then. In addition to the recognition problem, the gizmo that holds the ink cartridges is supposed to slide to the left when the machine is opened up, but it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't. If it doesn't, it's very difficult to raise the lid over the cartridges as it's blocked by another part of the printer. Did I mention lousy design??Bottom line: steer clear of anything Epson. Their poor excuse for customer service is only exceeded by the terrible design and poor quality of their products."

						StaticText 'Since the day my printer was purchased the color printing has not worked. I bought it NEW only a few months ago and I\'ve tried everything. I thought it was the ink it came with originally, so I switched it out for new ink and it still does a poor job(see the attached pictures). I did A LOT of research for home-office printers and actually this one came very highly rated! I read reviews, I did the consumer reports research, I did it all! However, since the day I bought mine, it hasn\'t functioned properly! Now I am rating it with 1 star really for the COLOR PRINTING ONLY. I mean, who buys a color printer that can\'t print in color anyway and expects it to get over 1 star?I went online looking for a customer support phone number; I couldn\'t find one. So I sent a facebook message to Epson explaining the issue. I needed help quickly and I was hoping they could do it online since most of my experience with technical support for computer stuff has been bad and I\'m stressed enough. Well, needless to say I think I\'ve had my intelligence insulted by Epson more times than I can handle. The person basically told me a list of things I should try to AVOID with my Epson printer; I never knew a lot of these things. Apparently their printer works better if you download what you need to print, save it first to your computer then print it-- instead of printing directly off the screen or website.However, the worst was when the person on the phone with customer service (I wanted to avoid this) asked me to take out the ink cartridges and read her the numbers on it (making sure I had installed the right ink to begin with) and then CHECK THE BOTTOM FOR TAPE. I never said it wasn\'t printing ANY color by the way, I have been saying it prints color POORLY!! So by the end of my conversation she decided I\'m eligible for a replacement under warranty. However, my printer arrived broken. They want to give me a refurbished one, which I politely explained angered me for a number of reasons. First, my printer still is brand new, and I didn\'t buy a used printer off Amazon. Second, it arrived this way, it isn\'t like it all the sudden broke, it\'s been broken the whole time. I really loved what Epson said though. Her technical support is CLEARLY not customer support because her reasoning behind me getting a refurbished one is laughable, "it\'s not like we can resell yours, it\'s defective". Well duh! However, what about the NEW ONE that I was promised when I paid money for it? That one I\'m still kind of waiting for... Well my point is, BUYER BEWARE...DON\'T BUY THIS PRINTER... DON\'T DO IT, DON\'T DO IT!'

There should be a -5 option here for printers just like this.Worst printer I have ever owned. Wifi connectivity is awful. You will always struggle. Guzzles ink like no printer I have ever seen.

I bought this thing three years ago. I\'ve always had print quality issues with it. Never used aftermarket, always OEM ink. Always fighting with the stupid print quality and lines. Heck, I probably burned through an entire set of cartridges just printing test pages and alignment pages. It seems to burn through the ink faster than it should when it would work. When I\'m VPN\'ed into another network for whatever reason it breaks printing on this guy until I disconnect and then the queued job will go through. Other printers don\'t have this issue.I\'m about ready to take a sledgehammer to it right now because I\'m trying to get the driver installed on my second laptop just so I can scan some invoices to email to a client and I\'ve been fighting with the stupid installer for an hour now. First it detects the printer, but then can\'t "contact" it. I finally realize it\'s probably my VPN. Get off of that and now it detects just fine, but during the install wants to update the firmware. Fine. Only it fails for whatever reason. Then it just won\'t continue finishing installing the printer and scan driver.I will never ever shop an Epson again. This thing is such a piece of $#!7...'

						StaticText "It's definitely as bad as many of the reviews claim! I purchased it on Amazon in September 2016 for light home office duty, but it was having problems well before Christmas - mostly related to print head clogging. Most of the tiny toner cartridge's ink was wasted doing numerous head cleaning procedures while trying to get some sort of legible output from the printer. I've never printed a satisfying document from this printer and for the past 6 months, I've had to work on it for an hour or more every-time I wanted to print a single mailing label. It's been less than 20 months since I purchased it and I've only put 200 pages through it, but I've replaced the toner cartridges three times with OEM ink that cost twice the price of the whole printer. It's a really bad, unreliable, frustrating and amazingly expensive (to operate) printer and if for some strange reason you'd like one, mine's out on the curb in the trash today (where it should have been more than a year ago)."

						StaticText "I purchased this printer in July 2015. The print heads have clogged up numerous times from very early on. It was used daily in a 1 person office. I found instructions online for unclogging print heads. The instructions took time, but were effective. However, over time this has become incredibly tedious to do on a regular basis. I can't tell you how much ink has been wasted (that's where the real expense lies with these printers) from unclogging print heads and running nozzle cleaning. In addition, the printer would often not recognize the (always genuine Epson) ink cartridges after the cleaning, so the ink would be wasted. I also have the WF-7620 and it has had the exact same problem. I purchased a WorkForce 610 in 2009 and it just died (early 2017). These newer Epsons barely worked for a month. Ridiculous!"

						StaticText 'I\'m an Epson fan. Have owned multiple ones over the years. This is one of the fastest and easiest for small home office use. Here\'s are my ups and considerations to help you decide if its for you:Ups/Why I like it:-Easy, easy set up- Great quality printing with the option to get it faster or better qualtiy (admittedly my default is low quality, fast and B&W to save those color cartridge ink for when I need it.- Holds plenty of paper - in a real paper tray (instead of hanging over the back like some computers)- When I do print photos in color - they are incredibly crisp and clean- Multiple connection/printing options: Print from anywhere to it, print from your mobile to it, print with it connected wirelessly - or if the internet goes out - print from it connected by USB. I\'m pretty sure I haven\'t yet found every way you can print on this thing - but, I feel safe it\'s covered.- All the features an AIO needs -scan, fax, copy etc. They are there. They are easy to use and work like they should.The one caveat I always have about Epsons applies here. They tend to live by the "sell them cheap - and then make lots of $$$ for their life via very pricey printing ink refills". To get around this, I recommend:- Keep your default on B&W draft/fast for everyday printing,- don\'t always believe it when it tells you you\'re running out of ink (often there\'s plenty to go - and it will print with whatever cartridges have ink if you ask it to),- do a print test of a couple of a few pages before printing out a whole large document or multiple copies of larger documents, and always buy the cartridges with XL in them (T252XL not T252) - for about $10 more they will give you more than 3x the paper. (e.g. T252 = 300 pages, T252XL =1100pages). XL cartridges tend to run about $30 each.'

# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One or several actions, separated by new lines.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
My memory says that I filled the first name and last name, but I can't see any
content in the form. I need to explore different ways to fill the form. Perhaps
the form is not visible yet or some fields are disabled. I need to replan.
</think>

<action>
fill('b534', 'Montre', True)
click('a51')
click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])
</action>
