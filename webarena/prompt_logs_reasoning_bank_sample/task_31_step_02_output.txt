I will use the memory items because they all describe the same, relevant approach: identify comments with more downvotes than upvotes by checking each comment's displayed net score (negative values indicate more downvotes). Specifically:
- Use Memory 1: Yes — it describes counting comments with negative net scores and reporting the total.
- Use Memory 2: Yes — it reiterates that a negative displayed score means downvotes exceed upvotes; useful when scanning comment lists.
- Use Memory 3: Yes — same guidance, confirms counting negative net scores is the right method.

Next I need to find the user who made the latest post on the photoshopbattles forum. The page I'm on is the search results; I'll navigate to the Forums list to open the photoshopbattles forum and locate the latest post and its author.
