### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: Use — it describes checking each comment's displayed score (net upvotes minus downvotes) to determine downvote-majority. This matches the visible UI which shows a single score per comment.
Memory 2: Use — it clarifies that a single numeric score is the net score, and negative values indicate more downvotes than upvotes. We'll treat negative scores as the criterion.
Memory 3: Use — it reminds to handle pagination or lazy-loading when counting all comments. I need to scroll or load more comments to ensure I check the full comment list for this user.

Next action: scroll down to load more of the user's comments so I can inspect all comment scores (and then count how many have negative net scores).
