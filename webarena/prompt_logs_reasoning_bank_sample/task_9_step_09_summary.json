It matches the user's request to capture driving distances/times and the full address strings from the mapping interface.\nMemory 2: Use the page's directions/map tool to get travel distance and time — I will use this (yes). The page already has a directions widget; I'll use it to obtain road distances.\nMemory 3: Default origin and how to report driving distance — I will NOT use this (no) because an explicit origin (Carnegie Art Museum 800 Hobson Way Oxnard CA 93030) is already provided on the page.\nPlanned action: run the directions query (click the \"Go\" button) so the map/directions panel produces the driving distance/time and the full address shown for the current destination (Santa Barbara Municipal Airport). I'll then use the directions panel results to determine whether it is within 30 km; if not, I'll check other candidate international airports (e.g., LAX) in subsequent steps.",
