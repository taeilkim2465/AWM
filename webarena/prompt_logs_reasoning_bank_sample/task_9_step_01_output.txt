### LLM RESPONSE ###

Memory check:
- Memory 1 (use directions panel for proximity checks and report full details): I will use this — it matches the user's request to report driving distance/time and the full address string for each airport.
- Memory 2 (use the page's directions/map tool to get travel distance and time): I will use this — I should get driving distances from the map/directions widget.
- Memory 3 (default origin and how to report driving distance): Not needed as a default here because the user gave a specific place (Carnegie Art Museum). However I will verify the museum location on the map before running directions.

Plan:
1. Locate the Carnegie Art Museum on the map by refining the search query (include street address).
2. Open the directions/find route tool and check driving distances to candidate nearby international airports (e.g., LAX, SBA, maybe others) using the directions panel, and capture the full address strings displayed for each airport.
First step: re-run the search with a more specific query so the map can find the museum.
