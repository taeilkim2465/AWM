Memory 2: Not relevant (it's about review output format). I will not use it.

I need to find the latest post in the Showerthoughts forum, get its author, then count that author's comments which have more downvotes than upvotes. The page I'm on is a user profile with no comments listed. Next I should navigate to the Forums listing to find and open the Showerthoughts forum.
