### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 (check net scores) — USE. It directly describes how to identify comments with more downvotes than upvotes by looking for negative displayed scores.
Memory 2 (use profile/comments page and handle pagination) — USE. I will need to open the author's profile and look through their comments, accounting for pagination or "load more".
Memory 3 (open latest post author's profile) — USE. It tells me to navigate from the latest post to the author's profile, which is exactly how to find their comment history.

Next step: open the Forums page so I can find and open the Worcester forum and then locate its latest post. I'll click the "Forums" link in the top navigation.
