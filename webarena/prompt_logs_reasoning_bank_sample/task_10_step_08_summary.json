Next I'll query directions to Buffalo Niagara International Airport and then to Greater Rochester International Airport using the 'To' field and the \"Go\" button so I can capture the route distance/time and the full address strings shown by the map. I'll perform both queries now (each fill + Go), pausing briefly after each to let the directions panel update.",
