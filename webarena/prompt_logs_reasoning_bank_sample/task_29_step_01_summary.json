It describes checking each comment's displayed net score and counting negatives — relevant to deciding which comments have more downvotes.\n- Memory 2: Use. It clarifies that a single numeric score is typically net (upvotes minus downvotes) and negative values indicate downvote-majority — simplifies counting.\n- Memory 3: Use. It reminds to open the author's profile, go to their comments/activity, and handle pagination or \"load more\" to ensure we count all comments.\n\nNext I need to find the DIY forum in the forums list. It's not visible in the current viewport, so I'll scroll down the list to locate and open the DIY forum.",
