### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use all three memory items:

- Memory 1 (Confirm metric and sort): USE — I need to ensure "best-selling" is defined (units vs revenue) and that the report is sorted by that metric before trusting the top entry.
- Memory 2 (Use built-in quarter grouping): USE — I should use the report's period/granularity controls (Quarter) and set the period to Q1 2022 rather than summing months manually.
- Memory 3 (Order-status / returns filters): USE — I should confirm the report filters exclude cancelled/refunded/draft orders so results reflect finalized sales.

Next I will open the Reports section to find the Bestsellers report where I can set the period to Quarter, choose Q1 2022, confirm the metric (Quantity or Sales), and verify order-status filters.
