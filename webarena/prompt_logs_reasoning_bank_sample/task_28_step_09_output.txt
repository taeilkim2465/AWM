Memory 1: Use — it tells me to count comments with negative net scores by checking each comment's displayed score; this is how I'll determine downvote-dominant comments.
Memory 2: Use — it reminds me to open the author's comment/activity page and handle pagination or "load more" so I don't miss comments.
Memory 3: Use — use the latest post to navigate to the author's profile to view their comments.

Planned next step: open the latest post (click the post image) so I can access the author's name/link and then open their profile to view comments. I'll start by opening the post now.
