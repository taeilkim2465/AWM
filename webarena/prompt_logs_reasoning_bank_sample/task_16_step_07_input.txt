a user instructions. You can interact with the page and explore. Each time you
submit an action it will be sent to the browser and you will receive a new page.

# Instructions

You are a UI Assistant, your goal is to help the user perform tasks using a web browser. You can
communicate with the user via a chat, in which the user gives you instructions and in which you
can send back messages. You have access to a web browser that both you and the user can see,
and with which only you can interact via specific commands.

Review the instructions from the user, the current state of the page and all other information
to find the best possible next action to accomplish your goal. Your answer will be interpreted
and executed by a program, make sure to follow the formatting instructions.

**Current Progress**: Step 7/10 (3 steps remaining)

**Before choosing your next action:**
- Check your action history below - are you repeating the same actions?
- If yes, try a different approach (search, different menu, filters, etc.)
- Make sure each action brings you closer to completing the goal

## Chat messages:

 - [assistant] Hi! I am your UI assistant, I can perform web tasks for you. What can I help you with?
 - [user] Compare the time for walking and driving route from 5000 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh to UPMC family health center# Reasoning Memories

Below are some memory items that I accumulated from past interaction from the environment that may be helpful to solve the task. You can use it when you feel it's relevant. In each step, please first explicitly discuss if you want to use each memory item or not, and then take action.

Memory 1:
- Title: Use routing services and state route assumptions for distance and drive time
- Description: Compute closest park and driving time by querying a routing service and explicitly reporting assumptions (route type, traffic, units).
- Content: Prefer authoritative routing APIs for both distance and estimated drive time, use the fastest driving route by default, give both distance and time in the user's preferred units, and note whether estimates assume typical traffic, no traffic, or live conditions so the user can request alternatives.
Memory 2:
- Title: Use the directions panel to get driving distance and the formatted address
- Description: When checking proximity by driving distance, use the mapping/directions interface and extract the route's driving distance/time and the interface's formatted address for the destination.
- Content: Enter the origin and a candidate destination into the directions UI, choose the driving mode and select the recommended route, then record the displayed driving distance/time and the full formatted address shown in the directions panel. Confirm units (km vs miles) and convert if needed, and ensure you are reading the driving route results (not walking/transit).
Memory 3:
- Title: Use the page's directions/map routing tool for driving-distance requests
- Description: When the user asks about driving distance or travel time, compute routes with the map/directions widget rather than relying on straight-line measurements.
- Content: Route engines provide road distance and estimated travel time that reflect actual driving paths; use the page's directions tool to get these values. Only fall back to straight-line distances as a secondary cross-check when the routing result is ambiguous, unavailable, or to validate boundary cases.

        fill('a12', 'example with "quotes"')

        fill('b534', 'Montre', True)

select_option(bid: str, options: str | list[str])

    Examples:
        drag_and_drop('56', '498')

upload_file(bid: str, file: str | list[str])
    Description: Click an element and wait for a "filechooser" event, then select one or multiple input files for upload. Relative file paths are resolved relative to the current working directory. An empty list clears the selected files.

Multiple actions can be provided at once, but will be executed sequentially without any feedback from the page.
More than 2-3 actions usually leads to failure or unexpected behavior. Example:
fill('b534', 'Montre', True)
click('a51')
click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])


# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of
each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your
answer:

<think>
Think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect
that your previous action had on the current content of the page.
</think>

<action>
One or several actions, separated by new lines.
</action>

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer.
Make sure to follow the template with proper tags:

<think>
My memory says that I filled the first name and last name, but I can't see any
content in the form. I need to explore different ways to fill the form. Perhaps
the form is not visible yet or some fields are disabled. I need to replan.
</think>

<action>
fill('b534', 'Montre', True)
click('a51')
click('48', button='middle', modifiers=['Shift'])
</action>
