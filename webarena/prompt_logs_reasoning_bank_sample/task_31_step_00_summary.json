Specifically:\n- Memory 1: Use — it outlines counting comments with negative net scores.\n- Memory 2: Use — reiterates that a negative displayed score indicates downvote-majority.\n- Memory 3: Use — confirms treating negative net scores as the criterion.\n\nNext I need to navigate from the current page to the Forums list to find the photoshopbattles forum and then locate the latest post and its author. I'll start by opening the Forums page by clicking the \"Forums\" link.",
