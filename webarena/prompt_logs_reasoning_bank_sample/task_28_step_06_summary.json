It describes counting comments with negative net score (downvotes > upvotes) which is exactly how to determine \"more downvotes than upvotes\".\n- Memory 2 (open author's comment/activity page and handle pagination): I will use this. Once I find the author of the latest post, I need to view their comment history (possibly paginated) to count comments with net negative scores.\n- Memory 3 (open latest post author's profile): I will use this. I first need to find the latest post on the Worcester forum and open its author's profile.\n\nPlan: navigate to the Worcester forum page (click the \"WorcesterMA\" link) so I can find the latest post and its author. From there I'll sort/find the newest post, open it, click the author's profile, then inspect their comments and count those with negative net scores (handling pagination if needed).\n\nNext action: open the Worcester forum page by clicking the \"WorcesterMA\" link at the top search result.",
