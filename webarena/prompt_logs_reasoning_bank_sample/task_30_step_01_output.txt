### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 (Count comments with more downvotes than upvotes by checking net scores): I will use this — it describes checking each comment's displayed score and counting negatives, which matches the site's likely single-number net score display.

Memory 2 (Count negative net scores as downvote-majority): I will use this — it clarifies that a single negative numeric score indicates more downvotes than upvotes.

Memory 3 (Use the user's comment/activity page and handle pagination): I will use this — I need to open the author of the latest post on the space forum, go to their comments/activity feed, and ensure I traverse all pages or load more comments to count negatives.

Next, I'll open the "space" forum page to find the latest post and its author.
