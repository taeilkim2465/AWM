### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will not use Memory 1, Memory 2, or Memory 3 because they relate to refining/sorting/exporting reports and order-status metrics for sales data — they aren't relevant to finding reviewers who mention "under water" or "underwater" in the product reviews.

I need to check the second page of reviews (there are 12 reviews and a "Page 2" link visible) because I scanned page 1 and didn't see any mention of underwater photos. I'll navigate to page 2 and then look for words like "under water", "underwater", or "water" in the reviews there.
