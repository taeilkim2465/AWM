Reviewing the stored memories:
- Memory 1 (Validate stored memories): Relevant as a reminder to check relevance first. I will note it but not actively use specific content from it.
- Memory 2 and Memory 3 (search reviews/pagination): Not relevant to this task (they concern searching reviews), so I will not use them.

Next I should clarify the user's intent before using the map: "national park" can mean any National Park Service unit (including National Historical Parks like Boston National Historical Park, which is inside Boston) or the specific designation "National Park" (e.g., Acadia National Park). Also I need to know the starting point in Boston (downtown Boston vs a specific address) to compute driving distance accurately.

I will ask the user which definition they mean and confirm the start location, then proceed to search the map and compute driving distance.
