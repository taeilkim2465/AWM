I'll use the memories as follows:
- Memory 1 (check net scores): Yes — I'll count comments with negative net score (downvotes > upvotes) by inspecting each comment's displayed score.
- Memory 2 (use user's comment/activity page and handle pagination): Yes — once I open the author's profile, I'll go to their comments or activity tab and watch for pagination or "load more".
- Memory 3 (open latest post author's profile): Yes — I need to find the latest post in the Worcester forum and open the post author's profile to view their comments.

Plan: switch to the alphabetical forum listing to find "Worcester" quickly, open the Worcester forum, locate the latest post and click the author's name to open their profile, then view their comments and count negative-score comments (handling pagination if needed).

First I'll open the alphabetical forum view.
