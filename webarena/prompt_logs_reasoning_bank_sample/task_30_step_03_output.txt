### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 (check net score per comment) — USE: it's exactly the method we need: count comments with negative displayed scores.
Memory 2 (treat single numeric score as net score) — USE: the interface shows a single number for each comment, so negative numbers indicate downvote-majority.
Memory 3 (use user's comments/activity page and handle pagination) — USE: we're already on the user's overview; I should switch to the "Comments" tab to list only comments and then check all pages or load more if needed.

Next action: switch to the "Comments" tab so I can inspect every comment's net score and count the negative ones.
