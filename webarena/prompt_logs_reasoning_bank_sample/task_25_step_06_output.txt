Memory 1: Use it. It tells me the required output format (include exact snippets, reviewer name, date, review title, and a one-line summary). I'll follow that when reporting matches.

Memory 2: Use it. It reminds me to include verbatim snippets, attribution, and whether pagination was exhausted, and to offer to fetch more context. I'll report page numbers and offer to open full reviews if the user wants.

Memory 3: Use it. It instructs to search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination. I should navigate the reviews pages and look for the keywords (e.g., "average", "quality", "print quality"). Currently I'm on Reviews page 2. I'll go to Page 1 to check the other reviews for mentions about "average print quality" (or similar phrasing).

Next action: open Page 1 of the reviews so I can search those reviews too.
