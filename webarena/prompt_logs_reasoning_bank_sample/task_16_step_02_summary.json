Memory 1 (use authoritative routing API and state assumptions) is useful — I will report that the times come from OSRM and note the traffic assumption (OSRM estimates assume typical/no live traffic). I will use Memory 2 and Memory 3 (use the directions panel and mapping/routing tool) — they apply directly: I'll extract the displayed driving time (already visible) and then request walking directions from the same UI to get the walking time.\n\nPlan: switch the mode from Car to Foot in the directions mode selector and re-run the route to read the walking distance/time shown in the directions panel.",
