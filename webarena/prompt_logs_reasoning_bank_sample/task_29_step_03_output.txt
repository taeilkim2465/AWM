### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: Use — it tells me to inspect each comment's net score to find downvote-majority comments.
Memory 2: Use — it clarifies that a single numeric comment score is the net (up − down), so negative numbers mean more downvotes.
Memory 3: Use — it instructs to open the author's profile, check their comments/activity, and handle pagination or "load more" to examine all comments.

Plan: find the DIY forum from the forums list using the search box, open it, locate the latest post and its author, then open that author's profile and count comments with negative net scores. First I'll search the forums list for "DIY".
