I will use Memory 1, Memory 2, and Memory 3:

- Memory 1: Use. It reminds me to confirm which metric defines "best-selling" (units vs revenue) and to ensure the table is sorted by that metric. The table shows an "Order Quantity" column, so I'll make sure the report is using that metric and sort descending on it after the report loads.

- Memory 2: Use. It reminds me to check order-status/returns filters so canceled/refunded orders aren't counted. I don't see order-status filters on this Bestsellers Report page, so I'll proceed but keep in mind that if results look unexpected I may need to find a different report or settings to exclude refunds/cancels.

- Memory 3: Use. It suggests using the report's period grouping rather than manual summation. I'll set Period = Year and run the report for the full 2022 date range so the report will aggregate by product for the year.

Next actions: set Period to "Year", set From = 01/01/2022 and To = 12/31/2022, run "Show Report", then sort by the "Order Quantity" column to ensure the top rows reflect best-selling by units.
