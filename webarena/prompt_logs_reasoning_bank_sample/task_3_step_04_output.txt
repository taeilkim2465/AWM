### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1 (Confirm metric & sort): I will use this. The table shows a column "Order Quantity" which matches the "best-selling by units" metric; I should click the "Order Quantity" column header to ensure the table is sorted descending on that metric so the top row truly reflects the top seller.

Memory 2 (Check order-status and returns filters): I will consider this but not use an explicit filter action because the Bestsellers Report UI shown has only Period/From/To and Empty Rows controls — there are no visible order-status or returns filters on this page. If needed later, I can navigate to other report settings, but for now I'll proceed with the visible report controls.

Memory 3 (Use built-in aggregation / period granularity): I will use this. The Period is already set to "Year" and the From/To are 1/1/22–12/31/22, which matches the requested 2022 aggregation.

Next action: click the "Order Quantity" column header to confirm sorting by units.
