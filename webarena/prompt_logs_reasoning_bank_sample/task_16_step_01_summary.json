It reminds me to state assumptions about route type and traffic when reporting times.\n- Memory 2 (directions panel for driving distance & formatted address): Use. The directions UI on this page is the correct place to read the driving route time and formatted addresses.\n- Memory 3 (use page's routing tool for driving requests): Use. Prefer the site’s route engine rather than straight-line distances.\n\nPlan: fill the \"From\" and \"To\" boxes with the addresses (origin: \"5000 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh\"; destination: \"UPMC Family Health Center, Pittsburgh\"), then click Go to get the driving (Car) route. I will run the driving query first; afterwards I'll switch to walking (Foot) and query to compare times (in a later step).",
