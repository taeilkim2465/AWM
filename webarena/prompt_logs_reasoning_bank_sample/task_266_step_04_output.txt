Memory 1: Not useful — it's about searching paginated reviews, which doesn't apply to finding the nearest national park.
Memory 2: Not useful — same reason as Memory 1.
Memory 3: Not useful — again about paginated reviews, not relevant.

Plan: Acadia National Park is the only national park in Maine, so it's almost certainly the closest to Portland. To confirm and get a distance, I'll open the map's "Find directions between two points" tool and compute directions from Portland, Maine to Acadia National Park (this will give a distance and confirm it's the nearest).
