### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use the memory items:

- Memory 1 (Count comments with more downvotes than upvotes by checking net scores): Yes — this describes the method I should use (identify comments with negative net score).
- Memory 2 (Count negative net scores as downvote-majority): Yes — the site shows a single score per comment/post which is the net; negative means more downvotes.
- Memory 3 (Use the user's comment/activity page and handle pagination): Yes — I need to open the author's profile and look at their comments/activity, and may need to handle pagination or "load more".

Next step: open the profile of the user who made the latest post on this page (the first post: "The Moon, Saturn and Jupiter..." — user InternationalBack472) so I can view their comments/activity and count comments with negative net scores.
