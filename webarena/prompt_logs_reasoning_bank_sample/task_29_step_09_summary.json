None of the visible comments by Sorkill have negative net scores (all show non-negative numbers like 1, 16, 6, 4, 7, 13, 12, 281, etc.). Based on that, the count of comments with more downvotes than upvotes is 0. I can load more pages or traverse the user's full comment history if you want me to double-check.",
