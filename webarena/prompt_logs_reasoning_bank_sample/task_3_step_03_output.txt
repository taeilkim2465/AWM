I will use Memory 1 to ensure "best-selling" is defined by the correct metric and that the table is sorted by that metric. The table shows an "Order Quantity" column, so I'll click that column header to ensure the report is sorted descending by order quantity.

I will use Memory 2 to check for order-status / return filters. I don't see any order-status or returns filters in the Filter panel (only Period, From, To, Empty Rows and Scope), so I can't change that here — I'll assume the report reflects finalized sales or note this to you if you want me to investigate further.

I will use Memory 3 because the Period is set to "Year" and the date range is 1/1/22 to 12/31/22, which already matches the requested 2022 aggregation.

Next I'll click the "Order Quantity" column header to confirm the sort order.
