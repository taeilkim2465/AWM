### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory check and plan:
- Memory 1 (Confirm metric and sort order): I will use this. We must verify whether "best-selling" is by units or revenue and ensure the report is sorted descending on that metric.
- Memory 2 (Check order-status and return/refund filters): I will use this. The report should exclude cancelled/refunded/draft orders unless the user wants them included.
- Memory 3 (Prefer built-in aggregation and period granularity): I will use this. I'll open the full reports area and set the period to Year = 2022 so the report returns aggregated results for that year.

Next action: open the Reports section so I can find the Bestsellers product report with date and order-status filters and the appropriate metric/sort controls.
