Memory 1: Use routing services and state route assumptions — I will use this. I'll report that times come from OSRM on the page and note assumptions (OSRM estimates, typical/no live traffic for driving).

Memory 2: Use the directions panel to get driving distance and the formatted address — I will use this. The panel already shows the driving result (Distance: 1.2 km, Time: 0:02) which I'll record.

Memory 3: Use the page's directions/map routing tool for driving-distance requests — I will use this. To compare walking vs driving, I'll switch the route mode to "Foot (OSRM)" on the page and get the walking time from the directions panel.

Now I'll switch the route mode to Foot (OSRM) and request directions so I can read the walking time.
