### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use the remembered steps:
- Memory 1 (check net scores) — YES: I'll count comments with negative net scores.
- Memory 2 (open user's comment/activity and handle pagination) — YES: I need to open their profile/comments and handle any "load more" or pagination.
- Memory 3 (open latest post author's profile) — YES: I need to get to the author from the latest post.

I should avoid repeating an action that previously did nothing. Rather than clicking the author link again (which was clicked earlier with no visible change), I'll first open the latest post itself and then go to the author's profile from the post page. I'll click the post title to open the submission page.
