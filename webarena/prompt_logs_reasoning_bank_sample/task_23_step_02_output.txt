### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I'll use Memory 1 and Memory 2 for this step:
- Memory 1 (Report reviewer findings precisely and offer follow-ups): YES — I'll extract verbatim snippets, reviewer name, and date for any matches and offer to fetch more context or continue searching.
- Memory 2 (Search reviews by keyword and exhaust pagination): YES — I should check each reviews page (page 2 is visible now) and also open page 1 to search there so the search is comprehensive.
- Memory 3 (Offer tie-breaking and refinement options): NO for now — not needed yet.

Current page shows Reviews page 2. To search all reviews for mentions of "fingerprint" or "fingerprint resistant" I need to check page 1 as well. I'll navigate to Page 1 now.
