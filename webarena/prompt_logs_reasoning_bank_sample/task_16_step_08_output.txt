I will use the stored memories to guide how I get route times:
- Memory 1 (use routing services and state assumptions): I will use it — it reminds me to report assumptions about route type and traffic when I present times.
- Memory 2 (use the directions panel to get driving distance and formatted address): I will use it — the directions panel already shows the driving result and I should extract the walking result the same way.
- Memory 3 (use the page's directions/map routing tool for driving-distance requests): I will use it — the page's routing widget (OSRM) is the authoritative source for both driving and walking times here.

Next I need the walking travel time. The page currently shows the driving result. I will switch the mode to Foot (OSRM) and request directions so the panel updates with the walking distance and time.
