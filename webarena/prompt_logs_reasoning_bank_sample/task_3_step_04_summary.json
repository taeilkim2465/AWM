The table shows a column \"Order Quantity\" which matches the \"best-selling by units\" metric; I should click the \"Order Quantity\" column header to ensure the table is sorted descending on that metric so the top row truly reflects the top seller.\n\nMemory 2 (Check order-status and returns filters): I will consider this but not use an explicit filter action because the Bestsellers Report UI shown has only Period/From/To and Empty Rows controls — there are no visible order-status or returns filters on this page. If needed later, I can navigate to other report settings, but for now I'll proceed with the visible report controls.\n\nMemory 3 (Use built-in aggregation / period granularity): I will use this. The Period is already set to \"Year\" and the From/To are 1/1/22–12/31/22, which matches the requested 2022 aggregation.\n\nNext action: click the \"Order Quantity\" column header to confirm sorting by units.",
