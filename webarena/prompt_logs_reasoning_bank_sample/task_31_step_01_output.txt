### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: Use — it describes counting comments with negative net scores and reporting the total; this matches the task.
Memory 2: Use — it reiterates that a negative displayed score indicates more downvotes; I'll rely on that to identify comments.
Memory 3: Use — same idea, confirms counting negative net scores is the correct method.

Next step: find the photoshopbattles forum page. The current page lists forums and has a search box (element 50). I'll search for "photoshopbattles" to go to that forum.
