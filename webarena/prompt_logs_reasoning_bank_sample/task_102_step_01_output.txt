### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I'll use the memories to guide the next steps:
- Memory 1 (Filter repository issues by label using the Issues search box): Yes — this is directly applicable, but I need to open the Issues page first.
- Memory 2 (Use the repository issues search to filter by label): Yes — once on the Issues page I'll apply a label-based search query in the issues search box.
- Memory 3 (Broaden or combine label filters): I'll keep this in mind if the initial label filter returns few or no results.

Next I'll open the repository's Issues page so I can apply a label filter there.
