  "think": "Memory 1 (routing & assumptions): I will use this — when I compute distance and bike time I'll use a routing method and state assumptions (route type, traffic/conditions). I'll ask the user to confirm any preference (e.g., include ferries, assume typical conditions).\n\nMemory 2 (clarify \"national park\" vs all NPS units): I will use this — the term is ambiguous for the answer (official National Park vs any National Park Service unit). I should ask which the user means; if they don't answer I'll default to official \"National Park\" and state that assumption.\n\nMemory 3 (default origin = city downtown): I will use this — the user didn't give an address, so I'll assume downtown Vinalhaven as the start point and state that assumption. I'll ask if they prefer a different origin.\n\nPlanned next step: ask the user two quick clarifying questions so I can compute an accurate bike time: 1) do they mean only official \"National Parks\" or all NPS sites (monuments, historic sites, etc.)? 2) should the biking time include ferry segments (i.e., bike onto ferries where required) or only continuous cycling routes on land? I'll also confirm I should assume downtown Vinalhaven as the origin and that estimates will assume typical conditions.",
