### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: Use. It tells me to inspect each comment's displayed net score and count those with a negative score — that's the straightforward way to identify downvote-majority comments on this page.

Memory 2: Use. It clarifies that a single numeric score shown per comment is the net score (upvotes minus downvotes), so negative values indicate more downvotes than upvotes.

Memory 3: Use. It reminds me to traverse the user's comment list fully (pagination or lazy-loading). I need to load more comments on the page (if any) so I can check all scores.

Plan: scroll down to load more of this user's comments (handle lazy loading/pagination) and then inspect the visible scores for any negative values. I'll scroll further now to reveal more comments.
