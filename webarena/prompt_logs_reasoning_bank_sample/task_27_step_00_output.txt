### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
I will use the memory items as follows:
- Memory 1 (check net scores): Yes — this gives a quick way to identify comments with more downvotes than upvotes by looking for negative displayed scores, but only if the UI displays net score.
- Memory 2 (use author's comment/activity page and handle pagination): Yes — I will open the author’s profile and check their comments/activity tab, making sure to handle pagination or "load more" to count all comments.
- Memory 3 (verify what the displayed score represents): Yes — I will confirm whether the UI shows a net score or separate up/down counts before using the displayed number to decide if downvotes > upvotes.

Next I need to navigate to the Forums page to find the Showerthoughts forum and locate the latest post there, so I'll click the "Forums" link.
