Memory 1: I will use this. It advises to confirm the metric and sort order — the table shows an "Order Quantity" column, so I'll click that column header to ensure the report is sorted by order quantity (descending) so the top row truly reflects the best-selling product by units.

Memory 2: I will not rely on changing "Period" because the Period control does not list "Quarter" (only Day/Month/Year). However, the From/To fields are already set to 1/1/22–3/31/22 (Q1 2022), so the date range is correct. I'll proceed with the existing date range.

Memory 3: I will consider this but cannot find order-status or returns filters on the visible UI to adjust. Since no such filter is exposed here, I will proceed with the displayed report but note that ideally we would verify order-status filters if available.

Planned action: click the "Order Quantity" column header to sort by that metric and then read the top row to determine the top-1 best-selling product for Q1 2022.
