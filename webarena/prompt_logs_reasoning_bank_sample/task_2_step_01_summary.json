I need to confirm whether \"best-selling\" is by units or revenue and ensure the report is sorted by that metric.\n- Memory 2: Use it. I should use the report's period/grouping controls to set the period to Quarter and select Q1 2022 rather than summing months manually.\n- Memory 3: Use it. I should check filters for order status and refunds so the metric reflects finalized sales only.\n\nNext I'll open the Reports > Products > Bestsellers report so I can inspect and set the metric, period (Quarter = Q1 2022), and order-status/refund filters.",
