It says to use the mapping/directions tool and report the full address shown for each result; I will follow this.\n- Memory 2: Use it. It instructs to report map-address, route distance/time, and whether it meets the threshold and to offer follow-ups; I'll gather the map address and distances first.\n- Memory 3: Use it. It recommends filling origin/destination in the directions widget to get driving distance/time; that is the procedure I'll perform.\n\nPlanned actions: load the route to Buffalo-Niagara International Airport to read the route distance/time and address, then check Niagara Falls International Airport, and then check Greater Rochester International Airport (to confirm whether it is within 60 km). I'll click \"Go\" for the current destination (Buffalo), wait for the route to load, then set the To field to Niagara Falls International Airport, get its route, then set the To field to Greater Rochester International Airport and get that route. I will run these actions now so I can read the resulting distances and addresses from the directions panel in the next step.",
