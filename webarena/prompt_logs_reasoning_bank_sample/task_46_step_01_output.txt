I will use the memories:
- Memory 1: Use — it tells me to show the open issues filtered to "Open" and sorted by newest; the page already shows "Open 21" and Created date descending.
- Memory 2: Use — it says to report the total count first; the UI shows "Open 21".
- Memory 3: Use — it asks for a concise summary of the top items; I'll present a compact list with issue number, title, key labels, and relative age.

Plan: confirm total open count and sort order, then report the top visible open issues from the list (issue number, short title, labels if present, relative age, and comment count).
