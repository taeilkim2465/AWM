Memory 1 (check net scores): I will use this — the page shows a single numeric score next to each comment which I will interpret as net score (upvotes minus downvotes), so negatives indicate more downvotes.
Memory 2 (use user's comments page and handle pagination): I will use this — I'm on the user's Comments tab; I'll note if there are pagination or "load more" controls (none visible).
Memory 3 (verify what the displayed score represents): I will use this — I will treat the displayed numbers as net scores for the count.

I can see two visible comments for the user Waoonet with scores "2" and "3" (both positive). There are no negative scores or pagination controls visible on the page, so none of the shown comments have more downvotes than upvotes.
