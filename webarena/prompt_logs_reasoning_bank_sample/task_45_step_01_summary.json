It explicitly says to open the issues list filtered to \"Open\" and sorted by newest and to report top items; that matches the task.\n- Memory 2: Use. It repeats the need to ensure the \"Open\" filter and sort by most recent and to note the total number of open issues.\n- Memory 3: Use. It instructs to present a concise summary of the top recent open issues, which is how I'll report results once the list is visible.\n\nNow I'll wait briefly for the issue list to finish loading and then scroll so the top issues load into view.",
