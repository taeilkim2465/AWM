### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory check:
- Memory 1 (default origin): Not needed — the user gave a specific origin (Carnegie Mellon University). I will state that I'm using CMU as the origin.
- Memory 2 (use the page's directions/map tool): Useful — I'll search for Carnegie Mellon University on OpenStreetMap and then use the map/directions features to measure driving distances to nearby international airports.
- Memory 3 (cross-check with straight-line distance): I may use this later if driving routes give ambiguous results, but I won't use it immediately.

Planned next action: search the map for "Carnegie Mellon University" to center the map on the university and reveal nearby airports / the directions widget.
