The report shows an \"Order Quantity\" column which matches \"best-selling by units\" — I should ensure the table is sorted by that column (descending). I'll click the \"Order Quantity\" column header to enforce the sort.\n\nMemory 2 (Prefer built-in aggregation / Quarter grouping): I will partially use this. The report's period control doesn't have a \"Quarter\" option (only Day/Month/Year) but the date range is already set to 1/1/22–3/31/22 (Q1). Since grouping by product type isn't available in the UI here, I'll rely on sorting the \"Order Quantity\" column to surface top items for the Q1 date range.\n\nMemory 3 (Check order-status and returns filters): I will use this. There are no visible order-status or returns filters on this page, so I note that the report may include all finalized orders by default. If needed I can check scope or other filters, but first I'll sort by Order Quantity to identify the top item.",
