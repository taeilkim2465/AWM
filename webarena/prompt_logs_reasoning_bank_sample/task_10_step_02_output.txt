I will use the stored memories because they match the user's request:
- Memory 1: USE — it tells me to use the mapping/directions tool and capture the full address shown in the map interface, which I should do.
- Memory 2: USE — it instructs to report map address, route distance/time, and whether it meets the threshold, which I will follow.
- Memory 3: USE — it reinforces that I should use the page's directions tool to get driving distance/time, which is exactly what I'll do.

Plan: the page already has a directions result for Buffalo-Niagara International Airport (Distance: 40 km). Next I'll change the destination to "Niagara Falls International Airport" and click Go to get the driving distance/time and the full address string shown in the "To" field. After that I'll test Greater Rochester International Airport as a candidate to confirm whether it falls within 60 km (if time/steps allow). For now I'll request the directions for Niagara Falls International Airport.
