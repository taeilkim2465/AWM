### LLM RESPONSE ###
<think>
Memory 1: Use routing services and state route assumptions — USE. It's relevant: I should report assumptions (fastest driving route, traffic ignored by OSRM) when giving times.

Memory 2: Use the directions panel to get driving distance and the formatted address — USE. The page's directions panel already shows distances/times for walking; I'll extract the driving result the same way.

Memory 3: Use the page's directions/map routing tool for driving-distance requests — USE. The page's routing widget (OSRM) is the authoritative source here.

Current page shows walking directions: "Distance: 1.2km. Time: 0:16." I will switch the routing mode to Car (OSRM) and run the route to get the driving time and distance, then report both values and note assumptions (OSRM estimates, typical/no live traffic).
