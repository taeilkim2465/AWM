Below are ONLY the FAILED steps from a task execution:
{trajectory}

---
Instructions:
1. Analyze the failed steps above. These steps were executed INCORRECTLY and did NOT achieve their intended goal.

2. Identify what caused these failures:
   - What mistakes were made? (e.g., clicking wrong element types, incorrect typing format)
   - What element selections failed and why? (e.g., choosing icons instead of buttons, selecting hidden elements)
   - What interaction patterns led to errors? (e.g., skipping required fields, not waiting for UI updates)

3. Extract LESSONS LEARNED and PREVENTION STRATEGIES:
   - What should have been done instead?
   - What warning signs indicate a similar mistake might occur?
   - What checks or validations could prevent this error?

4. Abstract these insights into reusable "Memory Items" as warnings for future tasks:
   - Focus on MISTAKES to avoid, not specific element IDs
   - Generalize from specific failures (e.g., "CLICK [456]" → "Avoid clicking decorative icons")
   - Identify anti-patterns that should be prevented

5. Format each item as:
   - **Title**: A short, catchy warning (3-5 words) that captures the pitfall.
   - **Description**: A one-sentence explanation of when this mistake typically occurs.
   - **Content**: The detailed explanation of WHY this is a mistake, WHAT went wrong, and HOW to prevent it in the future.

6. Output strictly a JSON list. Example:
[
  {{
    "title": "Don't Click Decorative Icons",
    "description": "Avoid when multiple visual elements appear near interactive controls.",
    "content": "Decorative SVG icons or images often do not have click handlers and will not trigger any action. Instead of clicking icons, look for the associated labeled button or control (e.g., a button with text 'Search' next to a magnifying glass icon). If you click an icon and see no response, immediately try the nearest labeled button."
  }}
