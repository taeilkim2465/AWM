Instructions:
1. Analyze the trajectory above.
   - If Outcome is SUCCESS: Identify the key strategic decisions or specific reasoning that led to success. What makes this approach effective?
   - If Outcome is FAILURE: Identify the critical mistake or missing knowledge. What *should* the agent have done or known?

2. Abstract these insights into "Memory Items". 
   - A Memory Item should be reusable for similar future tasks.
   - Do NOT include specific IDs (e.g., "CLICK [23]") in the abstracted content. Use descriptions (e.g., "Click the search icon").

3. Format each item as:
   - **Title**: A short, catchy summary (3-5 words).
   - **Description**: A one-sentence explanation of when to apply this.
   - **Content**: The detailed reasoning or strategy.

4. Output strictly a JSON list. Example:
[
  {{
    "title": "Handling Dynamic Dates",
    "description": "Use when standard date input fields are read-only.",
    "content": "On travel sites, date inputs are often read-only. Look for a calendar icon button next to the input to open the date picker widget."
  }}
]
