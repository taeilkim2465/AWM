Website: REI (shopping)

Workflows (common reusable sub-routines)

1) navigate_to_section
Purpose: open a top-level site section (e.g., Gift Cards, Membership, Cleats).
Steps:
- Click the header/navigation primary link or menu.
- Click the desired section/category link (e.g., Gift Cards, Membership, Cleats).

2) filter_results_by_size
Purpose: narrow product listings by size.
Steps:
- Click the "Filter by" / Size filter control.
- Select the desired size option (e.g., Large).

3) select_product_and_add_to_cart
Purpose: choose a product and place it in the cart.
Steps:
- Click the product listing or product link to open/select the item.
- Click the product's "Add to cart" (or "Add to Cart $X") button.

4) create_and_add_e-gift_card
Purpose: pick an e-gift design, enter recipient/sender info and add the e-gift to cart.
Steps:
- Open the E-Gift Cards section (use navigate_to_section if needed) and choose the E-Gift card tab.
- Click the desired design (e.g., the Congrats SVG).
- Type the recipient's name into the "To" field.
- Type the sender's name into the "From" field (if required).
- Type the recipient's email address into the email field.
- Click "Add to cart".

Notes:
- Workflows are intentionally minimal and composable — e.g., navigate_to_section + filter_results_by_size + select_product_and_add_to_cart can be chained to find and buy a filtered product.
