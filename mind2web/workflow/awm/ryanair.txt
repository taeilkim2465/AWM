Here are non-overlapping, commonly reused workflows extracted from the Ryanair tasks. Each workflow is a reusable sub-routine with parameter placeholders where appropriate.

1) open_service_tab
Purpose: Open the site’s main planning menu and switch to the desired service tab (e.g., Hotels, Events & Activities).
Steps:
- CLICK the Plan/menu button (if present)
- CLICK the {service-tab} (e.g., Hotels, Events & Activities)

2) enter_and_select_destination
Purpose: Enter a destination and pick the site suggestion.
Steps:
- CLICK the destination input (or focus the Destination field)
- TYPE: {destination-name}
- CLICK the matching suggestion from the tooltip/list (e.g., "{destination}, {region}")

3) select_date_from_calendar
Purpose: Pick a date from an on-page calendar widget (applies to check-in, check-out, event date).
Steps:
- CLICK the calendar control (e.g., Check-in / Check-out / date selector)
- CLICK the {date} element in the calendar (e.g., "13", "25 March")

4) set_guests_and_rooms
Purpose: Configure number of travellers and rooms for a hotel search.
Steps:
- CLICK the Guests and rooms control
- ADJUST counters as needed (increase/decrease adults, children)
- CLICK + Add room (if additional rooms required)
- CLICK Done (to confirm guests/rooms)

5) submit_search_and_open_result
Purpose: Run the search and open a first actionable result (choose room / get tickets / view offer).
Steps:
- CLICK the search action button (e.g., Search / Go! / Check availability / Let's go)
- CLICK the desired result action (e.g., Choose room / Get tickets / Book now)

6) filter_events_by_category_location_and_sort
Purpose: Narrow event/activity listings by category, location/country, date and sort order.
Steps:
- CLICK Categories
- CLICK the {category} (e.g., Family Friendly, Food & Drink)
- CLICK the {location/country} filter (e.g., Denmark, Ireland)
- CLICK the desired date (via date picker) or date option
- CLICK the sort option (e.g., Most popular / Lowest price) and then open an event (Get tickets / Check availability)

Use these workflows as building blocks to assemble the full task sequences (open tab → enter destination → select dates → set guests → submit search → choose result; or open events → filter by category/location/date → view tickets).
